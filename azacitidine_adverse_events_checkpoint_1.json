    "abstract": "Enasidenib is an oral IDH2 inhibitor that reduces the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, differentiating IDH2 mutated leukemic cells with initial promising results for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. We performed a retrospective study in Spain evaluating enasidenib in patients diagnosed with IDH2-mutated myeloid neoplasms (AML, MDS, myeloid sarcoma and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Twenty-three patients were included, with 20 having a refractory/relapsed (R/R) disease status. The median age was 73 years, and the majority patients were classified as adverse risk by the European LeukemiaNet 2022 criteria. The most frequent mutation was IDH2 R140 (69.6%), while 30.4% had R172 mutation. Enasidenib was administered as a single agent in 18 patients, in combination with azacitidine in four patients, and with low-dose cytarabine in another one. The median number of cycles administered was four, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 39.1% and a morphological complete remission (CR) rate of 26.1%. Median overall survival (OS) was 8.3 months. Patients who achieved a complete response had a better outcome than the rest of the patients in terms of OS (19.8 months (95%CI: 15.7-NR) vs. 4.2 (95%CI: 1.5-NR), p\u2009=\u20090.01). Drug-related events included leukocytosis in five patients (21.7%), hyperbilirubinemia in six patients (26.1%) and differentiation syndrome (DS) in four patients (17.4%), including one grade 3 DS and one death related to this latter adverse event (AE), similar to previous findings. Although enasidenib failed to demonstrate a clear overall survival advantage in phase 3 trials, the extended responses and long-term survivors observed herein underscore its therapeutic potential. Ultimately, our data support enasidenib's role as a targeted therapy for IDH2-mutated AML, indicating that expanded access to this agent is warranted to optimize outcomes in these challenging patient populations, especially for R/R AML patients.",

    "abstract": "Atraumatic splenic rupture (ASR) is rare and typically attributed to underlying pathological conditions, with neoplastic diseases being the main etiologies. Traditionally, surgical intervention has been the standard approach for managing ASR in the majority of patients. However, reports on the outcomes of conservative management, especially for ASR related to myeloid neoplasms, are scarce. Here, we present two case reports involving ASR associated with myeloid neoplasms. The first patient, suffering from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) harboring CBL and ASXL1 mutations, developed ASR shortly after receiving treatment with the hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine. The second patient, in the blast phase of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), experienced ASR during the progression of their disease. In the initial case, despite experiencing intense abdominal pain and hypovolemic shock, the patient responded favorably to prompt fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion upon, thanks to a timely diagnosis. A non-operative management approach successfully averted the need for splenectomy or arterial embolism, leading to a favorable outcome. In the second case, the patient presented with progressive abdominal pain but remained hemodynamic stability throughout the ASR episode. We opted for a cautious approach, prioritizing resuscitation, close monitoring, and a watchful waiting strategy. Regrettably, the patient's condition deteriorated, marked by increasing splenomegaly, unchecked leukocytosis, and recurrent parenchymal hemorrhages. Here, we report two cases of ASR in myeloid neoplasms, demonstrating that patients may achieve acceptable outcomes with conservative management.",

We conducted a single-center, dose-escalation, Phase I/II trial (NCT04550442) involving 33 patients with HR-MDS or CMML (IPSS \u2265 1.5) who had progressed after prior HMA therapy. Patients received intravenous or subcutaneous azacitidine (SC) (75\u202fmg/m\u00b2 for 5 days) and venetoclax (100-400\u202fmg for 7-14 days in a 28-day cycle). The primary endpoints were safety/tolerability (Phase 1) and overall response rate (ORR) (Phase 2). Patients received a median of 3 cycles (range, 1-22). The maximum tolerated dose of venetoclax was 400\u202fmg. Common grade 3-4 adverse events included neutropenia (19\u202f%) and thrombocytopenia (10\u202f%). The 4-week early mortality rate was 9\u202f%. The ORR was 49\u202f%, and the median overall survival (OS) was 7 months (95\u202f% CI, 3.5-10.5).

The combination of hypomethylating agents with venetoclax (Ven) has demonstrated promising results in these diseases, although randomized clinical trials are needed for validation. In this retrospective study, we compared two matched cohorts of patients with MDS or CMML: one receiving oral decitabine-cedazuridine (DEC-C, n\u2009=\u200973) and one receiving DEC-C and Ven (DEC-C-Ven, n\u2009=\u200951), in three contemporary clinical trials. The aim is to determine the impact of the addition of Ven to HMA in MDS and CMML. Individuals were matched using a propensity score approach that was based on the IPSS-M score and age. All patients had excess blasts; 84% were diagnosed with MDS and 16% with CMML. Most patients had high- or very high-risk disease, according to the revised IPSS-R. The overall response rate was superior in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (90% vs 64%, P\u2009=\u20090.002). The median times to best response were 1.1 and 2.7 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.001). More patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (47%) than in the DEC-C cohort (16%, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The 4- and 8-week mortality did not significantly differ between the DEC-C and DEC-C-Ven cohorts. Patients in the DEC-C-Ven cohort had a more profound neutropenia at days 15 and 21 of the first cycle. The median overall survival was 24 and 19 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.89), and the median event-free survival durations were 18 and 10 months (P\u2009=\u20090.026).
