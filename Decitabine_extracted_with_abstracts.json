The present analysis evaluated the efficacy, safety and pharmacodynamics of the oral DNMTi decitabine/cedazuridine in the subset of patients with CMML from the phase 2 and 3 trials, which led to the approval of this agent for myelodysplastic syndromes and CMML in the United States and Canada. Potential prognostic factors also were analysed. In all, 34 patients with CMML were screened and 33 were treated. Most patients (76% [n = 25]) had myelodysplastic type-CMML and 77% (n = 24/31 with DNA available for sequencing) had intermediate-2 or high-risk disease noted by CMML-specific prognostic scoring systems. The overall response rate was 76%, with 21% (n = 7) of patients achieving a complete response. Nearly half of the 11 patients who were red blood cell-transfusion dependent at baseline (46%) attained transfusion independence for >/=12 weeks, which was associated with survival. Median overall and transformation-free survival were 35.7 and 28.3 months, respectively, and the safety profile was similar to that previously reported for decitabine. This analysis described the use of decitabine/cedazuridine in CMML from consecutive, prospective, randomised trials and illustrated a median survival of nearly 3 years."

    "abstract": "Although decitabine (DAC) shows activity against myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), patient responses are limited, and prognoses remain poor. Preclinical studies have indicated that arsenic trioxide (ATO) and carboplatin (Carbo) enhance DAC's epigenetic gene derepression. Consequently, we initiated a randomized phase 2 clinical trial evaluating DAC alone, or with Carbo or ATO, in patients with MDS/AML. Thirty patients were initially randomized to receive DAC alone (20 mg/m(2), days 1-5), DAC plus Carbo (AUC 5, day 8), or DAC plus ATO (0.15 mg/kg, days 1-5), followed by adaptive randomization of 61 patients, based on response rates, for at least three 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was composite response rate; secondary endpoints included 1-year median survival, safety, and epigenetic effects. Among 91 patients (44 relapsed/refractory), no significant grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed. Response rates were 26.7% for DAC alone, 14.3% for DAC/Carbo, and 32.3% for DAC/ATO, with DAC/ATO achieving significantly higher responses (P = .041) and more stable disease (P = .018). MDS diagnosis and prior treatment status were key response predictors. Patients with MDS receiving DAC/ATO had the longest survival (16.5 months), compared to DAC/Carbo (4.6 months) and DAC alone (9.3 months) (P = .039). Epigenetic effects were similar across groups. DAC/ATO was well tolerated and improved clinical responses and survival, compared to DAC or DAC/Carbo, particularly in MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02190695."

    "abstract": "Mature plasmacytoid dendritic cell proliferation (MPDCP) is a rare, clonal but nonmalignant entity often associated with myeloid neoplasms such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myelodysplastic syndromes, and acute myeloid leukemia. While typically confined to the bone marrow, nodal MPDCP is exceedingly rare and may mimic blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), posing diagnostic challenges. We report a 78-year-old male with CMML-1 and progressive cervical lymphadenopathy. Workup revealed monocytosis, ASXL1 and CBL mutations, and CMML. Lymph node biopsy showed paracortical expansion by small mononuclear cells with plasmacytoid features. Immunophenotyping identified a CD4+, CD123+, CD303+, HLA-DR+, lysozyme+, CD56- population, consistent with MPDCP. A subset expressed TdT and granzyme B, with a Ki-67 index of 20% to 30%. Next-generation sequencing confirmed the same ASXL1 and CBL mutations in the lymph node, supporting clonal relation to CMML. Key differential diagnoses included BPDCN, T-cell lymphomas, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. Absence of CD56, mature cytomorphology, and molecular concordance favored MPDCP. This case highlights the importance of distinguishing nodal MPDCP from malignant mimics. MPDCP may reflect immune evasion, altered cytokine signaling, or clonal progression in myeloid neoplasms. The patient was initially treated with hydroxyurea, later transitioned to decitabine/cedazuridine (Inqovi) for disease progression. Follow-up marrow biopsy showed stable CMML-2 with persistent mutations, and the patient remains under close monitoring. Recognizing MPDCP in unusual locations is critical for accurate diagnosis and prognostication. Further studies are warranted to clarify its molecular pathogenesis and potential as a biomarker of disease evolution in CMML and related disorders. FAU - Al-Nusair, Jowan"

The combination of hypomethylating agents with venetoclax (Ven) has demonstrated promising results in these diseases, although randomized clinical trials are needed for validation. In this retrospective study, we compared two matched cohorts of patients with MDS or CMML: one receiving oral decitabine-cedazuridine (DEC-C, n = 73) and one receiving DEC-C and Ven (DEC-C-Ven, n = 51), in three contemporary clinical trials. The aim is to determine the impact of the addition of Ven to HMA in MDS and CMML. Individuals were matched using a propensity score approach that was based on the IPSS-M score and age. All patients had excess blasts; 84% were diagnosed with MDS and 16% with CMML. Most patients had high- or very high-risk disease, according to the revised IPSS-R. The overall response rate was superior in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (90% vs 64%, P = 0.002). The median times to best response were 1.1 and 2.7 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P < 0.001). More patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (47%) than in the DEC-C cohort (16%, P < 0.001). The 4- and 8-week mortality did not significantly differ between the DEC-C and DEC-C-Ven cohorts. Patients in the DEC-C-Ven cohort had a more profound neutropenia at days 15 and 21 of the first cycle. The median overall survival was 24 and 19 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P = 0.89), and the median event-free survival durations were 18 and 10 months (P = 0.026). In conclusion, the addition of Ven resulted in improved response rates and outcomes in specific subgroups; prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings."

    "abstract": "What is this summary about?This summary describes results from a phase 3 clinical trial called ASCERTAIN.Researchers compared two treatments in people with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), either of which can develop into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). One group was treated with oral decitabine and cedazuridine (oral DEC-C) and the other with intravenous decitabine.Treatment was given in a series of cycles. In the first cycle, people were randomly assigned to receive oral DEC-C or intravenous decitabine and then switched to the other treatment in the second cycle. After the first two cycles, everyone received oral DEC-C. The aim was to compare whether the same amount of decitabine reached people's bloodstream in a certain time period after receiving oral DEC-C or intravenous decitabine (known as pharmacokinetics). Researchers also looked at how long people lived while taking treatment, how long people lived without developing AML, and the side effects from receiving treatment.What were the results?The amount of decitabine in the bloodstream during the first 5 days of treatment was almost the same (99% similar) between people who received oral DEC-C and those who received intravenous decitabine. Among people treated with oral DEC-C, the median overall survival was 31.8 months. Overall, people lived without developing AML for a median of 31.7 months. Among people who required red blood cell transfusion at the start of the trial, 52% achieved transfusion independence during the trial with oral DEC-C. Side effects of oral DEC-C were similar to those of intravenous decitabine,most commonly thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. There were five treatment-related deaths during the trial; two in the oral DEC-C group and three in the intravenous decitabine group.What do the results mean?Oral DEC-C was as effective, and had similar side effects, as treatment with intravenous decitabine. Although the trial did not focus on quality of life, oral medicines require fewer visits to a clinic compared with intravenous medicines, which could make it easier for people to stay on treatment. This trial supports using oral DEC-C for treating people with MDS or CMML.[Box: see text].

We present a 58-year-old woman with a past medical history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who demonstrated 24% bone marrow blasts on a repeat biopsy obtained two years after being diagnosed with CMML. By the flow cytometric analysis, the blasts expressed partial CD34, CD13, CD117, partial MPO, and partial CD123 with coexpression of the T-lymphoid markers CD2, CD5, CD7, partial CD4, cytoplasmic CD3, partial cytoplasmic TDT, and CD38, suggestive of AML with rare mixed myeloid/T-cell phenotype. Treatment with various agents including decitabine, cytarabine, daunorubicin, etoposide, and venetoclax, and two experimental bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibitors did not produce sustained remissions, and the patient eventually succumbed to her disease. T-cell phenotype is an exceedingly rare feature of AML ex CMML, and whether this unique differentiation pathway contributed to the aggressive disease course remains unclear.

Since 2017, twelve agents have been approved for the treatment of AML subsets: the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax; the CD33 antibody drug conjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin; three FLT3 inhibitors (midostaurin, gilteritinib, quizartinib); three IDH inhibitors (ivosidenib and olutasidenib targeting IDH1 mutations; enasidenib targeting IDH2 mutations); two oral hypomethylating agents (oral poorly absorbable azacitidine; fully absorbable decitabine-cedazuridine [latter approved as an alternative to parenteral hypomethylating agents in myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia but commonly used in AML]); and CPX-351 (encapsulated liposomal 5:1 molar ratio of cytarabine and daunorubicin), and glasdegib (hedgehog inhibitor). Other targeted therapies (menin inhibitors, CD123 antibody-drug conjugates) are showing promising results. To achieve optimal results in such a rare and heterogeneous entity as AML requires expertise, familiarity with this rare cancer, and the access to, and delivery of disparate therapies under rigorous supportive care conditions. In this review, we update the standard-of-care and investigational therapies and outline promising current and future research directions."

    "abstract": "DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) play a crucial role in genomic DNA methylation. In mammals, DNMTs regulate the dynamic patterns of DNA methylation in embryonic and adult cells. Abnormal functions of DNMTs are often indicative of cancers, including overall hypomethylation and partial hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSG), which accelerate the malignancy of tumors, worsen the condition of patients, and significantly exacerbate the difficulty of cancer treatment. Currently, nucleoside DNMT inhibitors such as Azacytidine and Decitabine have been approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Therefore, targeting DNMTs is a very promising anti-tumor strategy. This review mainly summarizes the therapeutic effects of DNMT inhibitors on cancers. It aims to provide more possibilities for the treatment of cancers by discovering more DNMT inhibitors with high activity, high selectivity, and good drug-like properties in the future."

Here, we present the results of a single-center phase 2 trial of this agent for patients with higher-risk MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Guadecitabine was administered at a dose of 60 mg/m2 subcutaneously for 5 days. Of 100 enrolled patients, 82% had MDS. The median age was 69 years, and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was intermediate-2 in 78% and high in 14%. Thirty-eight percent had complex cytogenetics, and 32% had TP53 (mut) . By the International Working Group 2006 (IWG-2006) criteria, 25% achieved complete remission (CR), 30% marrow CR, and 33% no response (NR). Common grade 3 events were febrile neutropenia (32%) and infection (25%). Mortality rates at 4 and 8 weeks were 0% and 4%, respectively. The median overall survival (mOS) was 16.8 months. Patients who underwent transplantation (21%) had an mOS of 46.6 months. We then reanalyzed this data set using IPSS-Molecular (IPSS-M) and IWG-2023 response criteria. By IPSS-M, 60% of patients were classified as very high and 27% as high risk. By IWG-2023, overall response rate was 52%, with 30% CR, 14% CR with limited count recovery, and 42% NR. IPSS-M provided adequate risk stratification at enrollment. Patients classified as marrow CR had widely different outcomes when reclassified by IWG-2023. In conclusion, SGI-110 was active in high-risk MDS, but survival is unlikely to be superior to current hypomethylating agents. The study is registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT02131597."

    "abstract": "DISEASE OVERVIEW: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder with overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms, characterized by prominent monocytosis and an inherent risk for leukemic transformation (~15%-20% over 3-5 years). DIAGNOSIS: Newly revised diagnostic criteria include sustained (>3 months) peripheral blood (PB) monocytosis (>/=0.5 x 10(9)/L; monocytes >/=10% of leukocyte count), consistent bone marrow (BM) morphology, <20% BM or PB blasts (including promonocytes), and cytogenetic or molecular evidence of clonality. Cytogenetic abnormalities occur in ~30% of patients, while >95% harbor somatic mutations: TET2 (~60%), SRSF2 (~50%), ASXL1 (~40%), RAS pathway (~30%), and others. The presence of ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations and absence of TET2 mutations negatively impact overall survival (ASXL1(WT)/TET2(MT) genotype being favorable). RISK STRATIFICATION: Several risk models serve similar purposes in identifying high-risk patients that are considered for allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) earlier than later. Risk factors in the Mayo Molecular Model (MMM) include presence of truncating ASXL1 mutations, absolute monocyte count >10 x 10(9)/L, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, platelet count <100 x 10(9)/L, and the presence of circulating immature myeloid cells; the resulting 4-tiered risk categorization includes high (>/=3 risk factors), intermediate-2 (2 risk factors), intermediate-1 (1 risk factor), and low (no risk factors); the corresponding median survivals were 16, 31, 59, and 97 months. CMML is also classified as being \"myeloproliferative (MP-CMML)\" or \"myelodysplastic (MD-CMML),\" based on the presence or absence of leukocyte count of >/=13 x 10(9)/L. TREATMENT: ASCT is the only treatment modality that secures cure or long-term survival and is appropriate for MMM high/intermediate-2 risk disease. Drug therapy is currently not disease-modifying and includes hydroxyurea and hypomethylating agents; a recent phase-3 study (DACOTA) comparing hydroxyurea and decitabine, in high-risk MP-CMML, showed similar overall survival at 23.1 versus 18.4 months, respectively, despite response rates being higher for decitabine (56% vs. 31%). UNIQUE DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS: These include systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases, leukemia cutis and lysozyme-induced nephropathy; the latter requires close monitoring of renal function during leukocytosis and is a potential indication for cytoreductive therapy."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy and safety of hypomethylating agent therapy in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). METHODS: From February 2014 to June 2021, the clinical data, efficacy, survival time and safety of CMML patients diagnosed in the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University and treated with hypomethylating agent therapy were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 25 CMML patients received hypomethylating agent therapy, including 18 cases treated with decitabine (DEC) and 7 cases treated with azacytidine (AZA) as the basic treatment. Among them, 20 patients responded, and 7 patients got complete remission (CR). All patients with CR were treated with DEC as the basic treatment. Five cases of CR occurred in the first 4 courses of treatment. After a median follow-up of 16.4 (9.4-20.5) months, 4 patients with CR progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The median overall survival (OS) time of 25 CMML patients was 17.4 months (95%CI: 12.437-22.363). According to MD Anderson prognostic scoring system (MDAPS), CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS), CPSS molecular (CPSS-mol), Mayo molecular model (MMM), risk stratification of patients was performed, and the difference only between different risk stratification of MDAPS and survival time was statistically significant. Common adverse reactions of hypomethylating agent therapy in CMML patients included infection, gastrointestinal reaction, hematological toxicity, skin allergy and liver function damage. All patients' symptoms were improved after corresponding treatment. CONCLUSION: Hypomethylating agent therapy is effective and safe for CMML patients. CR mostly occurs in the first 4 courses of treatment, and hypomethylating agent therapy combined with low-dose chemotherapy can be used for patients who do not respond. Hypomethylating agent therapy can delay the disease, but can't prevent progression. FAU - Li, Xiao"

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypomethylating agents are approved in higher-riskmyelodysplastic syndromes. The combination of a hypomethylating agent with venetoclax is standard of care in acute myeloid leukaemia. We investigated the safety and activity of the first totally oral combination of decitabine plus cedazuridine and venetoclax in patients with higher-risk-myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. METHODS: We did a single-centre, dose-escalation and dose-expansion, phase 1/2, clinical trial. Patients with treatment-naive higher-risk-myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (risk level categorised as intermediate-2 or higher by the International Prognostic Scoring System) with excess blasts (>5%). Treatment consisted of oral decitabine 35 mg plus cedazuridine 100 mg on days 1-5 and venetoclax (variable doses of 100-400 mg, day 1 to 14, 28-day cycle). The primary outcomes were safety for the phase 1 part and the overall response for the phase 2 part of the study. The trial is ongoing and this analysis was not prespecified. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04655755, and is currently enrolling participants. FINDINGS: Between Jan 21, 2021, and Jan 20, 2023, we enrolled 39 patients (nine in phase 1 and 30 in phase 2). The median age was 71 years (range 27-94), 28 (72%) patients were male, and 11 (28%) were female. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and the recommended phase 2 dose was established as oral decitabine 35 mg plus cedazuridine 100 mg for 5 days and venetoclax (400 mg) for 14 days. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (33 [85%] of 39), neutropenia (29 [74%]), and febrile neutropenia (eight [21%]). Four non-treatment-related deaths occurred on the study drugs due to sepsis (n=2), lung infection (n=1), and undetermined cause (n=1). The median follow-up time was 10.8 months (IQR 5.6-16.4). The overall response rate was 95% (95% CI 83-99; 37/39). 19 (49%) patients proceeded to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. INTERPRETATION: This early analysis suggests that the combination of oral decitabine plus cedazuridine with venetoclax for higher-risk-myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia is safe in most patients, with encouraging activity. Longer follow-up will be needed to confirm these data. FUNDING: MD Anderson Cancer Center, MDS/AML Moon Shot, Genentech/AbbVie, and Astex Pharmaceuticals."

Oral therapy with similar exposure for these diseases would offer potential treatment benefits. We aimed to compare the safety and pharmacokinetics of oral decitabine plus the cytidine deaminase inhibitor cedazuridine versus intravenous decitabine. METHODS: We did a registrational, multicentre, open-label, crossover, phase 3 trial of individuals with myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and individuals with acute myeloid leukaemia, enrolled as separate cohorts; results for only participants with myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia are reported here. In 37 academic and community-based clinics in Canada and the USA, we enrolled individuals aged 18 years or older who were candidates to receive intravenous decitabine, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1 and a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 5 days of oral decitabine-cedazuridine (one tablet once daily containing 35 mg decitabine and 100 mg cedazuridine as a fixed-dose combination) or intravenous decitabine (20 mg/m(2) per day by continuous 1-h intravenous infusion) in a 28-day treatment cycle, followed by 5 days of the other formulation in the next treatment cycle. Thereafter, all participants received oral decitabine-cedazuridine from the third cycle on until treatment discontinuation. The primary endpoint was total decitabine exposure over 5 days with oral decitabine-cedazuridine versus intravenous decitabine for cycles 1 and 2, measured as area under the curve in participants who received the full treatment dose in cycles 1 and 2 and had decitabine daily AUC(0-24) for both oral decitabine-cedazuridine and intravenous decitabine (ie, paired cycles). On completion of the study, all patients were rolled over to a maintenance study. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03306264. FINDINGS: Between Feb 8, 2018, and June 7, 2021, 173 individuals were screened, 138 (80%) participants were randomly assigned to a treatment sequence, and 133 (96%) participants (87 [65%] men and 46 [35%] women; 121 [91%] White, four [3%] Black or African-American, three [2%] Asian, and five [4%] not reported) received treatment. Median follow-up was 966 days (IQR 917-1050). Primary endpoint of total exposure of oral decitabine-cedazuridine versus intravenous decitabine was 98.93% (90% CI 92.66-105.60), indicating equivalent pharmacokinetic exposure on the basis of area under the curve. The safety profiles of oral decitabine-cedazuridine and intravenous decitabine were similar. The most frequent adverse events of grade 3 or worse were thrombocytopenia (81 [61%] of 133 participants), neutropenia (76 [57%] participants), and anaemia (67 [50%] participants). The incidence of serious adverse events in cycles 1-2 was 31% (40 of 130 participants) with oral decitabine-cedazuridine and 18% (24 of 132 participants) with intravenous decitabine. There were five treatment-related deaths; two deemed related to oral therapy (sepsis and pneumonia) and three to intravenous treatment (septic shock [n=2] and pneumonia [n=1]). INTERPRETATION: Oral decitabine-cedazuridine was pharmacologically and pharmacodynamically equivalent to intravenous decitabine. The results support use of oral decitabine-cedazuridine as a safe and effective alternative to intravenous decitabine for treatment of individuals with myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia.

We characterized the real-world use of DEC-C through a Canadian compassionate use program. Demographic and clinical data from 769 patients enrolled in Taiho Pharma Canada's Patient Support Program were collected and analyzed. These patients represent a collection period from 10 November 2020 to 31 August 2022 with a median age of 76 years. Among 651 patients who started DEC-C, the median treatment duration was 4.2 cycles. The median overall and progression-free survival were 21.6 and 10.7 months, respectively.

ABSTRACT: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is considered to be a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic neoplasms. Usually it shares the features of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and is known as MDS/MPN. It occurs mostly in the elderly and has an inherent tendency to transform to acute myeloid leukemia. FDA has approved hypomethylating agents (HMAs) such as 5-azacitidine (AZA) and decitabine (DEC) for the treatment of this disorder. The extent of response rate to AZA varies considerably among patients. Our report describes a patient with CMML who not only did not respond to a conventional dose of intravenous (IV) therapy with AZA, but showed marked progression of the disease with the leucocyte count rising exponentially while undergoing the aforesaid treatment. We believe this is the first such case reported in the currently extant literature."

However, reliable clinical predictors of outcome have yet to be identified. The prognostic value of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels has been reported for decitabine therapy. We evaluated pretreatment HbF levels in AZA monotherapy as a prognostic marker in MDS/acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods This study included chemotherapy-naive patients who had received seven-day treatment schedules of AZA and whose HbF levels were measured at the onset of treatment between March 2011 and July 2020. Patients were grouped into HbF-normal (<1.0%) or HbF-elevated (>/=1.0%) groups. Responses were classified according to the International Working Group 2006 criteria. Patients Twenty-nine patients were included and classified as having either MDS (n=21), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n=5), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm unclassifiable (n=1), or AML with <30% marrow blasts (n=2) based on the World Health Organization 2016 diagnostic criteria. According to the revised International Prognostic Scoring System classification, 20/29 patients were at intermediate, high, or very high risk. Pretreatment HbF levels were elevated in 13/29 patients. Results The median follow-up duration was 13.0 (range 1.5-93.5) months. The HbF-elevated group was associated with a significantly higher hematologic improvement rate (76.9% vs. 25%, p=0.009) and better overall survival (median, 21.0 vs. 13.0 months, p=0.048) than the HbF-normal group. Conclusion These results suggest that elevated pretreatment HbF levels can predict better outcomes in patients with MDS/AML treated with AZA. FAU - Saga, Tomoyuki"

We reviewed 108 patients with hematological diseases including acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, and others who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from January 2019 through December 2020. After multivariable logistic regression, we found that splenomegaly (odds ratio [OR] = 26.98, p < .001) and JAK mutation (OR = 17.32, p = .024) were independent risk factors for PTR. During the period of transplantation, patients in the PTR group had a significantly higher platelet transfusion demand, which was reflected in the increased number of platelet transfusions (10.23 +/- 6.696 vs. 5.06 +/- 1.904, p < .001). After multivariate adjustment, PTR turned out to be independently associated with worse overall survival (hazard ratio = 2.794, 95% confidence interval = 1.083-7.207, p = .034). In conclusion, we found that splenomegaly and JAK gene mutation were independent risk factors for PTR in patients with hematological diseases.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Venetoclax (VEN) added to the hypomethylating agents (HMA) decitabine or azacitidine is the new standard of care for elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is being evaluated in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Current dosing of HMA/VEN relies on leukemia suppression through cytotoxicity which also impacts normal hematopoiesis. A regimen using once-weekly low-dose decitabine (LDDec) has demonstrated activity in myeloid malignancies. To overcome the severe myelosuppression often seen with HMA/VEN, we evaluated a once-weekly dosing regimen of VEN and LDDec in elderly and/or frail patients who were felt less likely to tolerate severe myelosuppression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-center analysis of patients with AML, MDS, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia treated with a once-weekly LDDec/VEN regimen. We also compare this regimen with a cohort treated with standard dosing HMA/VEN. RESULTS: In a retrospective cohort of 39 patients, the overall response rate for patients receiving LDDec/VEN for first-line AML and MDS was 88% and 64%, respectively. In patients with TP53 mutations, the composite complete response rate was 71% and the median overall survival was 10.7 months. When compared with 36 patients receiving standard dose HMA/VEN, the LDDec/VEN patients had a longer time on therapy (175 vs. 78 days; P = 0.014) and a trend toward a higher rate of transfusion independence (47% vs. 26%; P = 0.33). Neutropenic fever occurred in 31% of patients, with a median of one hospitalization at any point during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary clinical experience, although retrospective, provides proof-of-activity of noncytotoxic DNA methyltransferase 1-targeting by allowing frequent, sustained drug exposure often not possible with standard HMA/VEN regimens."

CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, the authors report a case of CMML in a 72-year-old male who presented with fever and abdominal pain for 2 days with a history of easy fatigability. Examination revealed pallor and palpable supraclavicular nodes. Investigations showed leukocytosis with a monocyte count of 22% of white blood cell count, 17% blast cells in bone marrow aspiration, increased blast/promonocytes, and positive markers in immunophenotyping. The patient is planned for injection of azacitidine, 7 days cycle for a total of six cycles. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: CMML is classified as overlapping myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms. It can be diagnosed based on a peripheral blood smear, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, chromosomal analysis, and genetic tests. The commonly used treatment options are hypomethylating agents like azacitidine and decitabine, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and cytoreductive agents like hydroxyurea. CONCLUSION: Despite various treatment options, the treatment is still unsatisfactory, demanding standard management strategies."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Hypomethylating agents may have adverse effects such as cytopenias, cytopenia associated infections and fatality due to infections despite their favorable effects in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The infection prophylaxis approach is based on expert opinions and real-life experiences. Hence, we aimed to reveal the frequence of infections, predisposing factors of infection and to analyse infection attributable mortality in patients with high-risk MDS, CMML and AML who received hypomethylating agents in our center where routine infection prophylaxis is not applied. MATERIAL-METHOD: 43 adult patients with AML or high-risk MDS or CMML who received HMA >/= 2 consecutive cycles from January 2014 to December 2020 were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: 43 patients and 173 treatment cycles were analyzed. The median age was 72 years and 61.3 % of patients were males. The distribution of the patients' diagnoses was; AML in 15 patients (34.9 %), high risk MDS in 20 patients (46.5 %), AML with myelodysplasia-related changes in 5 patients (11.6 %) and CMML in 3 patients (7 %). 38 infection events (21.9 %) occurred in 173 treatment cycles. 86.9 % (33 cycles) and 2.6 % (1 cycle) of infected cycles were bacterial and viral infections, respectively and 10.5 % (4 cycles) were bacterial and fungal concurrently. The most common origin of the infection was respiratory system. Hemoglobin count was lower and CRP level was higher at the beginning of the infected cycles significantly (p values were 0.002 and 0.012, respectively). Requirement of red blood cell and platelet transfusions were found to be significantly increased in the infected cycles (p values were 0.000 and 0.001, respectively). While > 4 cycles of treatment and increased platelet count were found to be protective against infection, > 6 points of Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were found to increase the risk of infection. The median survival was 7.8 months in non-infected cycles while 6.83 months in infected cycles. This difference was not statistically significant (p value was 0.077). DISCUSSION: The prevention and management of infections and infection-related deaths in patients treated with HMAs is crucial. Therefore, patients with a lower platelet count or a CCI score of > 6 may be candidates for infection prophylaxis when exposed to HMAs."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have shown efficacy in the treatment of hematological malignancies and are indicated for the treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). While the HMA decitabine, in its intravenous formulation, has been used since 2006 for the treatment of CMML, use of its oral formulation has been limited by poor bioavailability due to first-pass metabolism by the enzyme cytidine deaminase. The dose of intravenous decitabine is limited by toxicities such as cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Therefore, cedazuridine was developed as an inhibitor of cytidine deaminase. Cedazuridine decreases the first-pass metabolism of oral decitabine allowing therapeutic levels to be achieved at lower doses, and thus, the novel oral combination of cedazuridine with decitabine was developed. While cardiomyopathy and heart failure are well-established adverse effects associated with intravenous decitabine alone, there to our knowledge there have been no documented incidences of reversible cardiomyopathy in the literature or in patients who participated in the phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials of oral decitabine-cedazuridine. CASE: This case study presents an 85 year-old Caucasian female with CMML who developed cardiomyopathy and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction after completing 5 cycles of therapy with decitabine/cedazuridine. Furthermore, her symptoms and cardiac function recovered upon discontinuation of the drug. CONCLUSIONS: We present an occurrence of reversible cardiomyopathy in a patient who completed 5 cycles of decitabine/cedazuridine, an oral combination therapy developed to enhance oral bioavailability of decitabine thereby limiting its adverse effects. As the decitabine/cedazuridine combination therapy rises in popularity due to its convenient oral formulation, more trials are needed to understand the prevalence of cardiomyopathy with this drug and to discover preventative strategies for cardiotoxic effects."

We conducted a randomized phase III trial comparing decitabine (DAC) and HY in advanced myeloproliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukemias (CMML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed myeloproliferative CMML patients with advanced disease were randomly assigned 1:1 to intravenous DAC (20 mg/m(2)/d days 1-5) or HY (1-4 g/d) in 28-day cycles. The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS), events being death and acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML) transformation or progression. RESULTS: One-hundred seventy patients received DAC (n = 84) or HY (n = 86). Median age was 72 and 74 years, and median WBC count 32.5 x 10(9)/L and 31.2 x 10(9)/L in the DAC and HY arms, respectively. Thirty-three percent of DAC and 31% of HY patients had CMML-2. Patients received a median of five DAC and six HY cycles. With a median follow-up of 17.5 months, median EFS was 12.1 months in the DAC arm and 10.3 months in the HY arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.16; P = .27). There was no significant interaction between treatment effect and blast or platelet count, anemia, CMML Prognostic Scoring System, Groupe Francophone des Myelodysplasies, or CMML Prognostic Scoring System-mol risk. Fifty-three (63%) DAC patients achieved a response compared with 30 (35%) HY patients (P = .0004). Median duration of response was similar in both arms (DAC, 16.3 months; HY, 17.4 months; P = .90). Median overall survival was 18.4 months in the DAC arm and 21.9 months in the HY arm (P = .67). Compared with HY, DAC significantly reduced the risk of CMML progression or transformation to acute myelomonocytic leukemia (cause-specific HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.94; P = .005) at the expense of death without progression or transformation (cause-specific HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 0.82 to 2.9; P = .04). CONCLUSION: Compared with HY, frontline treatment with DAC did not improve EFS in patients with advanced myeloproliferative CMML (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02214407). FAU - Itzykson, Raphael"

Non-FA (or underlying FA) patients harboring heterozygous germline FA gene mutations may also face an increased risk of developing bone marrow failure, primary immunodeficiency disease, and hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes. We report a female patient who suffered from ovarian cancer at 50 years of age. During the initial treatment, six cycles of docetaxel and carboplatin (DC) combination chemotherapy were administered followed by two cycles of docetaxel maintenance therapy. Then, she received a routine follow-up every 3 months for the next 3 years, and all the results of the examination and laboratory tests were normal. Unfortunately, at 54 years of age, she developed a secondary cancer of therapy-related (t-) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (t-CMML). After two courses of a highly intensive induction chemotherapy regimen with DAC (decitabine) and HAA (homoharringtonine, cytarabine), the patient suffered from severe and persistent bone marrow failure (BMF). Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a panel of 80 genes was performed on her initial bone marrow aspirate sample and identified PTPN11, NRAS, and DNMT3A somatic mutations. In addition, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed a rare NUP98-HOXC11 fusion. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) verified RAD51C, BRIP1, PALB2, and FANCG heterozygous germline mutations of the FA pathway, which were further confirmed in buccal swab samples by Sanger sequencing. For this patient, we hypothesized that an altered FA pathway resulted in genomic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA-crosslinking agents or cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, and unsuccessful DNA damage repair. Consequently, she developed ovarian cancer and secondary t-CMML and then suffered from BMF and delayed post-chemotherapy bone marrow recovery after several chemotherapy courses. This case highlights the importance of genetic counseling in patients with hematopoietic neoplasms with high clinical suspicion for carrying cancer susceptibility gene mutations, which require timely diagnosis and personalized management."

We performed RNA sequencing in CD34(+) bone marrow stem hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (BM-HSPCs) from 51 patients with CMML and MDS before HMA treatment and compared transcriptomic signatures between responders and nonresponders. We observed very few genes with significant differential expression in HMA non-responders versus responders, and the commonly altered genes in non-responders to both azacitidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC) treatments were immunoglobulin genes. Gene set analysis identified 78 biological pathways commonly altered in non-responders to both treatments. Among these, we determined that the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor signaling significantly affected hematopoiesis in both human BM-HSPCs and mice, indicating that the transcriptomic signatures identified here could serve as candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HMA failure in MDS and CMML."

    "abstract": "Background Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myeloid neoplasm with features of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and myeloproliferative neoplasm presenting with peripheral blood monocytosis and an inherent risk for transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, while the abnormal DNA methylation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MDS, which is a disease of disordered differentiation. Recently, with the rapid development of molecular biology, hypomethylating agents (HMAs) for the treatment of MDS has gradually become a research focus. The objective of this study was to evaluate the benefits and risks of HMAs for patients with CMML. Materials and Methods PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and three Chinese databases were searched for studies published before November 2020 that used HMAs in CMML. Results The pooled objective response rate (ORR), complete response (CR), and partial response (PR) were 50.0, 21.0, and 2.0%, respectively. The proportion of patients with minor response (MR) was significantly higher for decitabine (DAC) than for azacitidine (AZA). There was no significant difference in hematologic improvement, ORR, CR, and PR rates between the DAC and AZA groups. Hematological toxicity included neutropenia grade 3/4 (14.0%), anemia grade 3/4 (17.0%), and thrombocytopenia grade 3/4 (22.0%). Conclusion This study showed that HMAs were effective and safe in the treatment of CMML, but large multicenter study would be needed to confirm the efficacy of HMAs for the treatment of CMML with different risk level and genetic abnormality, to support individualization treatment theoretically."

We describe the case of a 36-year-old male who presented with a subacute onset of polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, and fatigue. After an extensive workup, he was diagnosed with AML/CMML (chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) with a normal karyotype with DNMT3A, CBFB, and PTPN11 mutations. Further workup of the polyuria with a water deprivation test helped confirm the diagnosis of CDI along with MRI findings suggestive of hypophysitis. In this report, we analyze the clinical workup for AML and CDI and report the possibility of extramedullary leukemic infiltration associated with DNMT3A mutation, which has been reported as one of the mechanisms in the existing literature. We also discuss other theories hypothesized to cause CDI in AML patients with abnormal karyotypes. Our patient progressed to AML from CMML-2 after a cycle of decitabine, with confirmed gingival and presumed central nervous system (CNS) involvement. He is in minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete remission after induction with a CNS-active acute lymphoblastic leukemia-2 regimen. He also received double umbilical cord blood transplantation, conditioned with cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, thiotepa, and total body irradiation (TBI) of 4 Gy. This was complicated by engraftment syndrome for which he is currently being managed. CDI of the patient was corrected by desmopressin administration."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treated secondary acute myeloid leukemia (ts-AML)-i.e., AML arising from a previously treated antecedent hematologic disorder-is associated with very poor outcomes. The optimal frontline treatment regimen for these patients is uncertain. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 562 patients who developed AML from preceding myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia for which they had received a hypomethylating agent (HMA). Patients with ts-AML were stratified by frontline AML treatment with intensive chemotherapy (IC, n = 271), low-intensity therapy (LIT) without venetoclax (n = 237), or HMA plus venetoclax (n = 54). RESULTS: Compared with IC or LIT without venetoclax, HMA plus venetoclax resulted in higher CR/CRi rates (39% and 25%, respectively; P = 0.02) and superior OS (1-year OS 34% and 17%, respectively; P = 0.05). The benefit of HMA plus venetoclax was restricted to patients with non-adverse risk karyotype, where HMA plus venetoclax resulted in a median OS of 13.7 months and 1-year OS rate of 54%; in contrast, for patients with adverse risk karyotype, OS was similarly dismal regardless of treatment approach (median OS 3-5 months). A propensity score analysis accounting for relevant clinical variables confirmed the significant OS benefit of HMA plus venetoclax, as compared with other frontline treatment approaches. In a landmark analysis, patients with ts-AML who underwent subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) had superior 3-year OS compared to non-transplanted patients (33% vs. 8%, respectively; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of ts-AML are poor but may be improved with use of an HMA plus venetoclax-based regimen, followed by HSCT, particularly in those with a non-adverse risk karyotype."

    "abstract": "DISEASE OVERVIEW: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder with overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms, with an inherent risk for leukemic transformation (~15% over 3-5 years). DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on the presence of sustained (>3 months) peripheral blood monocytosis (>/=1 x 10(9) /L; monocytes >/=10%), usually with accompanying bone marrow dysplasia. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities occur in ~30% of patients, while >90% have somatic gene mutations. Mutations involving TET2 (~60%), SRSF2 (~50%), ASXL1 (~40%), and the oncogenic RAS pathway (~30%) are frequent, while the presence of ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations and the absence of TET2 mutations negatively impact overall survival. RISK-STRATIFICATION: Molecularly integrated prognostic models include the Groupe Francais des Myelodysplasies, Mayo Molecular Model (MMM), and the CMML specific prognostic model. Risk factors incorporated into the MMM include presence of truncating ASXL1 mutations, absolute monocyte count >10 x 10(9) /L, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, platelet count <100 x 10(9) /L, and the presence of circulating immature myeloid cells. The MMM stratifies CMML patients into four groups: high (>/=3 risk factors), intermediate-2 (2 risk factors), intermediate-1 (1 risk factor), and low (no risk factors), with median survivals of 16, 31, 59, and 97 months, respectively. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine are commonly used, with overall response rates of ~40%-50% and complete remission rates of ~7%-17%; with no impact on mutational allele burdens. Allogeneic stem cell transplant is the only potentially curative option but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality."

It primarily affects older people (median age at diagnosis ~72 years). There are many challenges encountered in its treatment. One striking issue is the lack of strong clinical evidence from large randomized clinical trials for treating this disease. Another issue is that patients with CMML have highly variable outcomes with current treatments. Additional challenges include a wider application of current knowledge, an improved understanding of pathogenesis, development of new therapies, and management of refractory cases/disease progression. It is clear that there is still progress to be made. Here, we review the available first-line treatment options for advanced CMML. Emphasis has been placed on choosing between hypomethylating agents and cytotoxic treatments, on the basis on disease-specific and patient-specific characteristics. A proper selection between these two treatments could lead to a better quality of care for patients with CMML."

The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, therapeutic use, adverse effects, clinical use controversies, product description, and upcoming trials for myelodysplastic syndromes novel agents luspatercept-aamt and decitabine/cedazuridine are reviewed. DATA SOURCES: This review article utilized primary information obtained from both the published studies involved in the approval of luspatercept-aamt and decitabine/cedazuridine and package inserts for the respective medications. This review article utilized secondary information obtained from National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines using filters and keywords to sustain information relevancy as well as key studies using the keywords, \"luspatercept-aamt, myelodysplastic syndromes, decitabine, cedazuridine, hypomethylating agent, ASTX727\" from scholarly journal database PubMed. DATA SUMMARY: Myelodysplastic syndromes consist of myeloid clonal hemopathies with a diverse range of presentation. Until recently, there have been relatively few new therapies in the myelodysplastic syndromes treatment landscape. On April 3, 2020 the US Food and Drug Administration approved Reblozyl((R))(luspatercept-aamt), then on July 7, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration approved INQOVI((R)) (decitabine and cedazuridine). Luspatercept-aamt acts as a erythroid maturation agent through differentiation of late-stage erythroid precursors. The safety and efficacy of luspatercept-aamt was demonstrated in the MEDALIST trial, a phase III trial in patients with very low-intermediate risk refractory myelodysplastic syndromes and ring sideroblasts. Luspatercept-aamt met both primary and secondary endpoints of transfusion independence of 8 weeks or longer and transfusion independence of 12 weeks or longer, respectively. Decitabine/cedazuridine has a unique mechanism of action in which decitabine acts as a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor promoting DNA hypomethylation and cedazuridine then prevents degradation of decitabine. The safety and efficacy of decitabine/cedazuridine was shown in the ASCERTAIN study, a phase III trial in patients with intermediate or high risk myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The primary outcome evaluated was 5-day cumulative area under the curve between decitabine/cedazuridine and IV decitabine as well as additional outcomes including safety. Decitabine/cedazuridine met primary outcome and had a similar safety profile to IV decitabine. CONCLUSION: The novel myelodysplastic syndromes agents luspatercept-aamt and decitabine/cedazuridine provide a clinical benefit in the studied populations. FAU - Xu, Katie"

METHODS: We performed next-generation sequencing on bone marrow aspiration samples of 59 patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts-2, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and treated with decitabine or azacitidine as a frontline therapy. RESULTS: A single gene with the most common mutations was TP53 (14 of 59 patients), and mutations in RAS pathway-related genes including KRAS, NRAS, FLT3, PTPN11, CBL, and KIT were found in 28.8% of patients. The overall response rate to HMAs was 33.9%. Predictive factors for a poor response were an age >75 years (p = 0.007), 3 or more gene mutations (p = 0.004), mutations in RAS pathway-related genes (p = 0.033), and a mutated NRAS gene (p = 0.042). An age >75 years (hazard ratio 2.946), diagnosis of AML (hazard ratio 2.915), and mutations in NRAS (hazard ratio 4.440) were identified as poor prognostic factors for survival. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, mutations in RAS pathway-related genes were predictors of a poor response to HMAs. Particularly, mutated NRAS was associated with inferior survival rates."

Median overall survival of this aggressive myeloid malignancy is only 2-3 years, with a 15-30% risk of acute leukemic transformation. The paucity of clinical trials specifically designed for CMML has made therapeutic management of CMML patients challenging. As a result, treatment paradigms for CMML patients are largely borrowed from MDS and MPN. The standard of care still relies on hydroxyurea, hypomethylating agents (HMA), and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, this latter option remaining the only potentially curative therapy. To date, approved drugs for CMML treatment are HMA, including azacitidine, decitabine, and more recently the oral combination of decitabine and cedazuridine. However, HMA treatment does not meaningfully alter the natural course of this disease. New treatment approaches for improving CMML-associated cytopenias or targeting the CMML malignant clone are emerging. More than 25 therapeutic agents are currently being evaluated in phase 1 or phase 2 clinical trials for CMML and other myeloid malignancies, often in combination with a HMA backbone. Several novel agents, such as sotatercept, ruxolitinib, lenzilumab, and tagraxofusp have shown promising clinical efficacy in CMML. Current evidence supports the idea that effective treatment in CMML will likely require combination therapy targeting multiple pathways, which emphasizes the need for additional new therapeutic options. This review focuses on recent therapeutic advances and innovative treatment strategies in CMML, including global and molecularly targeted approaches. We also discuss what may help to make progress in the design of rationally derived and disease-modifying therapies for CMML."

The development of oral HMAs has been an area of active interest; however, oral bioavailability has been quite poor due to rapid metabolism by cytidine deaminase (CDA). This led to the development of the novel CDA inhibitor cedazuridine, which was combined with an oral formulation of decitabine. Preclinical work demonstrated a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile approximate to parenteral decitabine, leading to early-phase clinical trials of oral cedazuridine-decitabine (C-DEC) in myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). A combination of oral decitabine 35 mg with oral cedazuridine 100 mg was established as the recommended phase 2 dose. Phase 2 data confirmed bioequivalence of C-DEC when compared with parenteral decitabine, and a larger phase 3 trial has demonstrated similar results, leading to the FDA approval of C-DEC for use in intermediate/high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and CMML. This review will focus upon the current role of HMA therapy in MDS/CMML, preclinical and clinical development of C-DEC, and potential roles of oral HMA therapy in myeloid malignancies moving forward."

This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched hematopoietic stem cell micro-transplantation (MST) in patients with MDS. A total of 22 patients with MDS, ranging between the ages of 39 and 74, were enrolled in this study. Eleven patients were given decitabine (DAC), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, combined with HLA-mismatched MST (MST-DAC group), and the remaining patients were given decitabine only (DAC group). The median overall survival (OS) of the MST-DAC group was higher than that of the DAC group (24 vs. 14.3 months; HR 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11-0.96; p = 0.04), although it is a study with small samples. The overall response rate (ORR), marrow complete remission (mCR), plus hematological improvement (HI) rates of the MST-DAC group were higher than that of the DAC group (81.8 vs. 54.5%, p = 0.36; 63.6 vs. 27.3%, p = 0.09, respectively); however, there were no statistical differences between the two groups, which may be attributed to the limited number of cases evaluated in this study. No graft-vs.-host disease was observed in the MST-DAC group. Patients in the MST-DAC group demonstrated a slightly lower incidence of hematological and non-hematological adverse events (AEs). DAC combined with HLA-mismatched MST may provide a novel, effective, and safe treatment for use in intermediate or high-risk MDS pathologies."

Following the approval of the cedazuridine/decitabine combination, ASTX727, as well as development of an oral formulation of azacitidine, CC-486, in the USA in 2020, these agents could gradually replace their injectable counterparts. AREAS COVERED: ASTX727 is approved for the treatment of adult patients with intermediate 1 or high-risk MDS as well as those with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia based on the findings from the ASTX727-01-B and ASCERTAIN trials. Oral azacitidine (CC-486) is approved for maintenance treatment of acute myeloid leukemia after induction chemotherapy for patients unfit for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant based on the findings from the QUAZAR AML-001 trial. EXPERT OPINION: Oral hypomethylating agent formulations have the potential to offer a convenient alternative to injectable hypomethylating agent. However, their current FDA-approved indications are narrow and efficacy needs to be shown in clinical trials before considering use beyond the approved indications. Areas of special interest include: identification of predictive biomarkers for clinical benefit, post-transplant maintenance therapy, and potential combination therapies with other oral agents such as venetoclax, IDH and FLT3 inhibitors.

Management decisions should be guided by individual patient and disease characteristics and based on validated risk stratification tools. While supportive care with red blood cell transfusions, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and iron chelation remains the mainstay of therapy for lower-risk (LR)-MDS patients, luspatercept has recently been approved for transfusion-dependent anemic LR-MDS patients ending a decade without any new drug approvals for MDS. For higher-risk patients, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) remains the only curative therapy for both MDS and CMML but most patients are not eligible for allo-HCT. For those patients, the hypomethylating agents (HMA) azacitidine and decitabine remain standard of care with azacitidine being the only agent that has shown an overall survival benefit in randomized trials. Although early results from novel molecularly driven agents such as IDH1/2 inhibitors, venetoclax, magrolimab, and APR-246 for MDS as well as tagraxofusp, tipifarnib, and lenzilumab for CMML appear encouraging, confirmatory randomized trials must be completed to fully assess their safety and efficacy prior to routine clinical use.

    "abstract": "Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by absolute monocytosis, one or more lineage dysplasia, and proliferative features including myeloid hyperplasia, splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms. Because of vast clinical heterogeneity in presentation and course, risk stratification is used for a risk-adapted treatment strategy. Numerous prognostic scoring systems exist, some of which incorporate mutational information. Treatment ranges from observation to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Therapies include hydroxyurea for cytoreduction, hypomethylating agents, and the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib to address splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms. Recently, oral decitabine with cedazuridine was approved and represents a convenient treatment option for CMML patients. Although novel therapeutics are in development for CMML, further work is needed to elucidate possible targets unique to the CMML clone. In this review, we will detail the pathophysiology, risk stratification, available treatment modalities, and novel therapies for CMML, and propose a modern treatment algorithm. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clinically heterogenous disease, which poses significant management challenges. The diagnosis of CMML requires bone marrow biopsy and aspirate with thorough evaluation. Risk stratification and symptom assessment are essential to designing an effective treatment plan, which may include hypomethylating agents (HMAs) in intermediate or high-risk patients. The recently approved oral decitabine/cedazuridine provides a convenient alternative to parenteral HMAs. Ruxolitinib may be effective in ameliorating proliferative symptoms and splenomegaly. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only treatment with curative potential; however, novel therapies are in clinical development which may significantly alter the therapeutic landscape of CMML."

METHODS: All available cohort studies of patients with CMML treated with decitabine and azacitidine were identified. The primary endpoints of this meta-analysis were response to hypomethylating agents. Pooled estimates of treatment response and drug-related adverse events were calculated using fixed or random effect models. RESULTS: Fourteen studies with 600 CMML patients (decitabine: n=196; azacitidine: n=404) were identified and included for meta-analysis. HMAs yielded a pooled ORR estimate of 43% (95% CI: 36%-50%) in patients with CMML. Patients received either azacitidine or decitabine exhibited comparable incidence of ORR (43% vs. 45%, P=0.810), while significantly higher incidence of mCR was observed in patients treated with decitabine (23% vs. 10%, P=0.000). Decitabine treatment was also associated with higher incidence of transfusion independence (42% vs. 20%, P=0.044). Both HMAs led to objective hematologic or non-hematologic AEs (27%-43%), while dosage modification/delay were more frequent in patients treated with azacitidine (81% vs. 67%, P=0.021). CONCLUSION: This current study may provide preliminary data in evaluating the efficacy and safety of HMAs in patients with CMML. Decitabine and azacitidine are comparable effective and safe in treating CMML. However, it is necessary to point out that any comparison of decitabine and azacitidine with respect to clinical outcomes can only be done in the context of a randomized controlled trial.

Based upon clinical symptoms, computed tomography findings, bone marrow aspiration, flow cytometry studies and cytogenetic analyses, the patient was diagnosed with PAP secondary to CMML. He underwent whole lung lavage in March 2016 to alleviate his dyspnea, after which he began combined chemotherapeutic treatment with decitabine and cytarabine. The patient died in January 2020 as a consequence of severe pulmonary infection.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is an aggressive hematopoietic malignancy that arises from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Patients with CMML are frequently treated with epigenetic therapeutic approaches, in particular the hypomethylating agents (HMAs), azacitidine (Aza) and decitabine (Dec). Although HMAs are believed to mediate their efficacy via re-expression of hypermethylated tumor suppressors, knowledge about relevant HMA targets is scarce. As silencing of tumor-suppressive micro-RNAs (miRs) by promoter hypermethylation is a crucial step in malignant transformation, we asked for a role of miRs in HMA efficacy in CMML. RESULTS: Initially, we performed genome-wide miR-expression profiling in a Kras(G12D)-induced CMML mouse model. Selected candidates with prominently decreased expression were validated by qPCR in CMML mice and human CMML patients. These experiments revealed the consistent decrease in miR-125a, a miR with previously described tumor-suppressive function in myeloid neoplasias. Furthermore, we show that miR-125a downregulation is caused by hypermethylation of its upstream region and can be reversed by HMA treatment. By employing both lentiviral and CRISPR/Cas9-based miR-125a modification, we demonstrate that HMA-induced miR-125a upregulation indeed contributes to mediating the anti-leukemic effects of these drugs. These data were validated in a clinical context, as miR-125a expression increased after HMA treatment in CMML patients, a phenomenon that was particularly pronounced in cases showing clinical response to these drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we report decreased expression of miR-125a in CMML and delineate its relevance as mediator of HMA efficacy within this neoplasia. FAU - Berg, Johannes Lorenz"

Therapeutic options for patients with CMML are limited, and although hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine and decitabine are the standard of care, only 40% of patients achieve a response, and most responses are transient. Over the last 5 years, significant advances have been made in the understanding of the clonal landscape of CMML, some of the mechanisms associated to resistance to HMA, and other key biological processes involved in disease pathogenesis. Areas covered: The current article reviews the most relevant emerging therapies currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of previously untreated or relapsed CMML. Expert opinion: The presence of recurrent somatic mutations in CMML represents therapeutic opportunities to utilize specific small molecule inhibitors such as IDH, FLT3, MEK/ERK, PLK1, or splicing inhibitors and modulators. In addition, other novel agents such as immune therapies, BCL2 or MCL1 inhibitors and other monoclonal antibodies could lead to therapeutic advances. Identifying specific patient populations likely to benefit from some of these interventions, and development of optimal combinations will remain the challenge when determining their role in therapy.

They consist of four adult onset entities including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), MDS/MPN-ring sideroblasts-thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T), BCR-ABL1 negative atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) and MDS/MPN-unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U); with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) being the only pediatric onset entity. Among these overlap neoplasms, CMML is the most frequent and is hallmarked by the presence of sustained peripheral blood monocytosis with recurrent mutations involving TET2 (60%), SRSF2 (50%) and ASXL1 (40%); with RAS pathway mutations and JAK2V617F being relatively enriched in proliferative CMML subtypes (WBC >/=13 x 109/L). CMML usually presents in the 7th decade of life, with a male preponderance and is associated with a median overall survival of <36 months. Adverse prognosticators in CMML include increasing age, high WBC, presence of circulating immature myeloid cells, anemia, thrombocytopenia and truncating ASXL1 mutations. While allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative option, given the late onset of this neoplasm and high frequency of comorbidities, most patients remain ineligible. Hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine, decitabine and oral decitabine/cedazuridine have been US FDA approved for the management of CMML, with overall response rates of 40-50% and complete remission rates of <20%. While these agents epigenetically restore hematopoiesis in a subset of responding patients, they do not impact mutational allele burdens and eventual disease progression to AML remains inevitable. Newer treatment modalities exploiting epigenetic, signaling and splicing abnormalities commonly seen in CMML are much needed."

Among nearly 10,000 patients investigated so far, molecular analyses documented NPM1 mutations in around 2% of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases, mainly belonging to MDS with excess of blasts, and 3% of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) cases, prevalently classified as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. These uncommon malignancies are associated with an aggressive clinical course, relatively rapid progression to overt acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and poor survival outcomes, raising controversies on their classification as distinct clinico-pathologic entities. Furthermore, fit patients with NPM1-mutated MNs with <20% blasts could benefit most from upfront intensive chemotherapy for AML rather than from moderate intensity MDS-directed therapies, although no firm conclusion can currently be drawn on best therapeutic approaches, due to the limited available data, obtained from small and mainly retrospective series. Caution is also suggested in definitely diagnosing NPM1-mutated MNs with blast count <20%, since NPM1-mutated AML cases frequently present dysplastic features and multilineage bone marrow cells showing abnormal cytoplasmic NPM1 protein delocalization by immunohistochemical staining, therefore belonging to NPM1-mutated clone regardless of blast morphology. Further prospective studies are warranted to definitely assess whether NPM1 mutations may become sufficient to diagnose AML, irrespective of blast percentage. FAU - Forghieri, Fabio"

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Venetoclax combined with hypomethylating agents is a new standard of care for newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are 75 years or older, or unfit for intensive chemotherapy. Pharmacodynamic studies have suggested superiority of the longer 10-day regimen of decitabine that has shown promising results in patients with high-risk AML in phase 2 trials. We hypothesised that venetoclax with 10-day decitabine could have improved activity in patients with newly diagnosed AML and those with relapsed or refractory AML, particularly in high-risk subgroups. METHODS: This single centre, phase 2 trial was done at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). The study enrolled older patients (aged >60 years) with newly diagnosed AML, not eligible for intensive chemotherapy; secondary AML (progressed after myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia); and relapsed or refractory AML. Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 3 or less, white blood cell count less than 10 x 10(9) per L, and adequate end-organ function. Patients with favourable-risk cytogenetics (eg, t[15;17] or core-binding factor AML) or who had received previous BCL2-inhibitor therapy were excluded. Patients received decitabine 20 mg/m(2) intravenously for 10 days with oral venetoclax 400 mg daily for induction, followed by decitabine for 5 days with daily venetoclax for consolidation. The primary endpoint was overall response rate. The secondary endpoints analysed within this report include safety, overall survival, and duration of response, in keeping with recommendations of European LeukemiaNet 2017 guidelines. All patients who received at least one dose of treatment were eligible for safety and response assessments. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03404193) and continues to accrue patients. FINDINGS: Between Jan 19, 2018, and Dec 16, 2019, we enrolled 168 patients; 70 (42%) had newly diagnosed AML, 15 (9%) had untreated secondary AML, 28 (17%) had treated secondary AML, and 55 (33%) had relapsed or refractory AML. The median age was 71 years (IQR 65-76) and 30% of patients had ECOG performance status of 2 or higher. The median follow-up for all patients was 16 months (95% CI 12-18; actual follow-up 6.5 months; IQR 3.4-12.4). The overall response rate was 74% (125 of 168 patients; 95% CI 67-80) and in disease subgroups were: 89% in newly diagnosed AML (62 of 70 patients; 79-94), 80% in untreated secondary AML (12 of 15 patients; 55-93), 61% in treated secondary AML (17 of 28 patients; 42-76), and 62% in relapsed or refractory AML (34 of 55 patients; 49-74). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included infections with grades 3 or 4 neutropenia (n=79, 47%) and febrile neutropenia (n=49, 29%). 139 (83%) of 168 patients had serious adverse events, most frequently neutropenic fever (n=63, 38%), followed by pneumonia (n=17, 10%) and sepsis (n=16, 10%). The 30-day mortality for all patients was 3.6% (n=6, 95% CI 1.7-7.8). The median overall survival was 18.1 months (95% CI 10.0-not reached) in newly diagnosed AML, 7.8 months (2.9-10.7) in untreated secondary AML, 6.0 months (3.4-13.7) in treated secondary AML, and 7.8 months (5.4-13.3) relapsed or refractory AML. The median duration of response was not reached (95% CI 9.0-not reached) in newly diagnosed AML, 5.1 months (95% CI 0.9-not reached) in untreated secondary AML, not reached (95% CI 2.5-not reached) in previously treated secondary AML, and 16.8 months (95% CI 6.6-not reached) in relapsed or refractory AML. INTERPRETATION: Venetoclax with 10-day decitabine has a manageable safety profile and showed high activity in newly diagnosed AML and molecularly defined subsets of relapsed or refractory AML. Future larger and randomised studies are needed to clarify activity in high-risk subsets. FUNDING: US National Institutes of Health and National Cancer Institute."

Decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor approved for the treatment of MDS and CMML, is degraded by cytidine deaminase in the gastrointestinal tract and liver, thereby limiting oral bioavailability. Cedazuridine is a proprietary, patented cytidine deaminase inhibitor that, when added to decitabine, increases oral bioavailability of the drug. In July 2020, decitabine/cedazuridine received its first approval in the USA and Canada for the treatment of MDS and CMML. In the USA, it is indicated for use in adults with MDS and CMML, including previously treated and untreated, de novo and secondary MDS with the following French-American-British subtypes (refractory anaemia, refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anaemia with excess blasts and CMML) and intermediate-1, intermediate-2 and high-risk International Prognostic Scoring System groups. Clinical studies for AML, glioma and solid tumours are underway in several countries worldwide.

Adults with International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-1/2- or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) were randomized 1:1 to receive oral cedazuridine/decitabine or IV decitabine in cycle 1, followed by crossover to the other treatment in cycle 2. All patients received oral cedazuridine/decitabine in subsequent cycles. Cedazuridine and decitabine were given initially as separate capsules in a dose-confirmation stage and then as a single fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet. Primary end points: mean decitabine systemic exposure (geometric least-squares mean [LSM]) of oral/IV 5-day area under curve from time 0 to last measurable concentration (AUClast), percentage long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) DNA demethylation for oral cedazuridine/decitabine vs IV decitabine, and clinical response. Eighty patients were randomized and treated. Oral/IV ratios of geometric LSM 5-day AUClast (80% confidence interval) were 93.5% (82.1-106.5) and 97.6% (80.5-118.3) for the dose-confirmation and FDC stages, respectively. Differences in mean %LINE-1 demethylation between oral and IV were </=1%. Clinical responses were observed in 48 patients (60%), including 17 (21%) with complete response. The most common grade >/=3 adverse events regardless of causality were neutropenia (46%), thrombocytopenia (38%), and febrile neutropenia (29%). Oral cedazuridine/decitabine (100/35 mg) produced similar systemic decitabine exposure, DNA demethylation, and safety vs decitabine 20 mg/m2 IV in the first 2 cycles, with similar efficacy.

    "abstract": "DISEASE OVERVIEW: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder with overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms, with an inherent risk for leukemic transformation (~15% over 3-5 years). DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on the presence of sustained (>3 months) peripheral blood monocytosis (>/=1 x 10(9) /L; monocytes >/=10%), along with bone marrow dysplasia. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities occur in ~ 30% of patients, while >90% have gene mutations. Mutations involving TET2 (~60%), SRSF2 (~50%), ASXL1 (~40%) and the oncogenic RAS pathway (~30%) are frequent; while the presence of ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations and the absence of TET2 mutations negatively impact over-all survival. RISK STRATIFICATION: Molecularly integrated prognostic models include; the Groupe Francais des Myelodysplasies (GFM), Mayo Molecular Model (MMM) and the CMML specific prognostic model (CPSS-Mol). Risk factors incorporated into the MMM include presence of nonsense or frameshift ASXL1 mutations, absolute monocyte count>10 x 10(9) /L, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, platelet count <100 x 10(9) /L and the presence of circulating immature myeloid cells. The MMM stratifies CMML patients into four groups; high (>/=3 risk factors), intermediate-2 (2 risk factors), intermediate-1 (1 risk factor) and low (no risk factors), with median survivals of 16, 31, 59 and 97 months, respectively. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine are commonly used, with overall response rates of ~40%-50% and complete remission rates of ~7%-17%; with no impact on mutational allele burdens. Allogeneic stem cell transplant is the only potentially curative option, but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality."

PARP1/2 and APE1 are critical enzymes involved in single-strand break repair and base excision repair, respectively. Here, we investigated the cytotoxic efficacy of talazoparib and APE1 inhibitor III, inhibitors of PARP1/2 and APE1, in primary CD34+ MDS/CMML cell samples (n = 8; 4 MDS and 4 CMML) and in primary CD34+ or CD34- AML cell samples (n = 18) in comparison to healthy CD34+ donor cell samples (n = 8). Strikingly, talazoparib and APE1 inhibitor III demonstrated critical antileukemic efficacy in selected MDS/CMML and AML cell samples. Low doses of talazoparib and APE1 inhibitor III further increased the cytotoxic efficacy of decitabine in MDS/CMML and AML cells. Moreover, low doses of APE1 inhibitor III increased the cytotoxic efficacy of talazoparib in MDS/CMML and AML cells. In summary, talazoparib and APE1 inhibitor III demonstrated substantial antileukemic efficacy as single agents, in combination with decitabine, and combined with each other. Hence, our findings support further investigation of these agents in sophisticated clinical trials. FAU - Kohl, Vanessa"

Outcomes remain uniformly poor with a median overall survival of ~2 years and an inherent risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (15-20% over 5 years). Due to unique biologic characteristics such as overlapping features of myelodysplasia and myeloproliferation, and clinical diversity despite relative genomic homogeneity, CMML represents a unique model to study chronic myeloid tumor biology. Recent advances have focused on understanding the role of putative genomic abnormalities, in particular, clonal evolution of pathogenic alterations in genes regulating the epigenome (TET2), chromatin architecture (ASXL1), spliceosome complex (SRSF2, SF3B1) and cell signaling (NRAS, KRAS, CBL, JAK2). Disease prognostication has evolved from purely clinical prognostic models to those incorporating pathogenic gene variations. Therapeutic options in this disease remain dismal with only two agents approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, namely 5-azacitidine and decitabine. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the sole curative option in this disease; however is associated with substantial treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Future areas of research include opportunities to further improve disease prognostication by employing novel technologies such as machine learning, incorporation of methylation and cytokine signatures, in addition to gene mutations; insights into clonal origins of this disease, and novel therapeutic strategies.

Here we assessed the efficacy of a new conditioning regimen comprising decitabine (Dec), busulfan (Bu), cyclophosphamide (Cy), fludarabine (Flu), and cytarabine (Ara-c) for allo-HSCT in patients with MDS and MDS/MPN.

At a median follow-up of 522 days (range, 15 to 1313 days), the overall survival (OS) was 86%, relapse incidence was 12%, and nonrelapse mortality was 12%. The incidence of severe acute (grade III-IV) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 23% and that of chronic GVHD was 15%. At 2 years, OS was 74% and 86%, respectively for high-risk and very-high-risk patients with MDS. Survival was promising in patients with poor-risk gene mutations, such as TP53 and ASXL1 (88%), and in those with >/=3 gene mutations (79%). Results of immunomonitoring studies revealed that proper natural killer cells made essential contributions to these favorable clinical outcomes. Overall, this new regimen was associated with a low relapse rate, low incidence and severity of GVHD, and satisfactory survival in allo-HSCT recipients with MDS and MDS/MPN."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Guadecitabine is a next-generation hypomethylating agent whose active metabolite decitabine has a longer in-vivo exposure time than intravenous decitabine. More effective hypomethylating agents are needed for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. In the present study, we aimed to compare the activity and safety of two doses of guadecitabine in hypomethylating agent treatment-naive or relapsed or refractory patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. METHODS: This phase 2 part of the phase 1/2, randomised, open-label study enrolled patients aged 18 years or older from 14 North American medical centres with International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-1-risk, intermediate-2-risk, or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. They were either hypomethylating agent treatment-naive or had relapsed or refractory disease after previous hypomethylating agent treatment as determined by the investigators' judgment. Eligible patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer algorithm for dynamic randomisation to subcutaneous guadecitabine 60 or 90 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 of a 28-day treatment cycle. Treatment was stratified by previous treatment with hypomethylating agents and neither patients nor investigators were masked. The primary endpoint was overall response (a composite of complete response, partial response, marrow complete response, and haematological improvement) assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01261312. FINDINGS: Between July 9, 2012, and April 7, 2014, 105 patients were enrolled: 55 (52%) were allocated to guadecitabine 60 mg/m(2) (28 patients were treatment-naive and 27 had relapsed or refractory disease after previous hypomethylating agent treatment) and 50 (48%) patients to 90 mg/m(2) (23 patients were treatment-naive and 27 had relapsed or refractory disease). Three (3%) patients of 105 did not receive study treatment and were excluded from analyses. Median follow-up was 3.2 years (IQR 2.8-3.5). The proportion of patients achieving an overall response did not significantly differ between dose groups (21 of 53 [40%, 95% CI 27-54] with 60 mg/m(2) and 27 of 49 [55%, 95% CI 40-69] with 90 mg/m(2); p=0.16). 25 of 49 (51%, 95% CI 36-66) patients who were treatment-naive and 23 of 53 (43%, 30-58) patients with relapsed or refractory disease achieved an overall response. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in both groups, regardless of relationship to treatment, were thrombocytopenia (22 [41%] of 53 patients in the 60 mg/m(2) group and 28 [57%] of 49 in the 90 mg/m(2) group), neutropaenia (21 [40%] and 25 [51%]), anaemia (25 [47%] and 24 [49%]), febrile neutropaenia (17 [32%] and 21 [43%]), and pneumonia (13 [25%] and 15 [31%]). Seven (7%) of 102 patients died due to adverse events (three with 90 mg/m(2) and four with 60 mg/m(2)), and all except one were in the relapsed or refractory cohort. Two deaths were deemed treatment related (septic shock with 60 mg/m(2); pneumonia with 90 mg/m(2)). INTERPRETATION: Guadecitabine was clinically active with acceptable tolerability in patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Responses and overall survival in the relapsed or refractory cohort offer the potential of a new therapeutic option for patients for whom currently available hypomethylating agents are not successful. We therefore recommend guadecitabine at a dose of 60 mg/m(2) on a 5-day schedule for these patients. FUNDING: Astex Pharmaceuticals and Stand Up To Cancer."

These efforts have yet to robustly identify biomarkers for these agents. The clinical activity of HMAs in myeloid neoplasms has been firmly established now but still remains of limited magnitude. Besides optimized use at different stages of the disease, most of the expected clinical progress with HMAs will come from the development of second-generation compounds orally available and/or with improved pharmacokinetics, and from the search, so far mostly empirical, of HMA-based synergistic drug combinations.

This dose-escalation study, guided by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic observations, evaluated whether simultaneous oral administration with the novel CDA inhibitor cedazuridine increases decitabine bioavailability for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. METHODS: In this phase 1 study, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. Eligible patients were assigned to cohorts to receive escalating oral doses of decitabine and cedazuridine. The starting dose was decitabine 20 mg and cedazuridine 40 mg. Treatment cycles lasted 28 days, with 5 days of drug administration. In cycle 1, each patient received a cohort-defined dose of oral decitabine on day -3, a 1-h intravenous infusion of decitabine 20 mg/m(2) on day 1, and cohort-defined doses of oral decitabine plus cedazuridine on days 2-5. In cycles 2 and beyond, the oral decitabine and cedazuridine were given on days 1-5. The dose of cedazuridine was escalated first and decitabine was escalated once CDA inhibition by cedazuridine approached the maximum effect. The drug dose was escalated if mean decitabine area under the curve (AUC) of the oral drug was less than 90% of that for intravenous decitabine in the cohort and if no dose-limiting toxicity was observed. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as a grade 3 or greater non-haematologic toxicity or grade 4 haematologic toxicity lasting more than 14 days and unrelated to the underlying disease. Once the decitabine AUC target range set as the primary endpoint, and established with intravenous decitabine, was reached at a dose deemed to be safe, the cohort that most closely approximated intravenous decitabine exposure was expanded to 18 evaluable patients. The primary objectives were to assess the safety of decitabine plus cedazuridine, and to determine the dose of each drug needed to achieve a mean AUC for decitabine exposure similar to that for intravenous decitabine exposure. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02103478. FINDINGS: Between Oct 28, 2014, and Nov 13, 2015, we enrolled 44 eligible patients (of 75 screened) with previously treated or newly diagnosed myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia; 43 of the enrolled patients were evaluable. Participants were treated in five cohorts: cohorts 1-4 included six evaluable patients each; cohort 5 included 19 patients in a 13-patient expansion. Dose-dependent increases in decitabine AUC and peak plasma concentration occurred with each cohort dose escalation. There was no evident increase in toxicity compared with that reported for intravenous decitabine. Decitabine 30 mg and 40 mg plus cedazuridine 100 mg produced mean day-5 decitabine AUCs (146 ng x h/mL for decitabine 30 mg, and 221 ng x h/mL for decitabine 40 mg) closest to the mean intravenous-decitabine AUC (164 ng x h/mL). The most common grade 3 or more adverse events were thrombocytopenia (18 [41%] of 44 patients), neutropenia (13 [30%]), anaemia (11 [25%]), leukopenia (seven [16%]), febrile neutropenia (seven [16%]), and pneumonia (seven [16%]). Four (9%) patients died because of adverse events, none of which was considered drug related, and three (7%) patients died more than 30 days after discontinuing treatment because of progressive disease (two [5%]) and respiratory failure (one [2%]). INTERPRETATION: Oral decitabine plus cedazuridine emulated the pharmacokinetics of intravenous decitabine, with a similar safety profile and dose-dependent demethylation. Clinical responses were similar to intravenous decitabine treatment for 5 days. Further study of decitabine plus cedazuridine as an alternative to parenteral therapy or in combination with other new oral agents for myeloid disorders is warranted.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alu repeats, belonging to the Short Interspersed Repetitive Elements (SINEs) class, contain about 25% of CpG sites in the human genome. Alu sequences lie in gene-rich regions, so their methylation is an important transcriptional regulation mechanism. Aberrant Alu methylation has been associated with tumor aggressiveness, and also previously discussed in hematological malignancies, by applying different approaches. Moreover, today different techniques designed to measure global DNA methylation are focused on the methylation level of specific repeat elements. In this work we propose a new method of investigating Alu differential methylation, based on droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) technology. METHODS: Forty-six patients with hematological neoplasms were included in the study: 30 patients affected by chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 7 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes at intermediate/high risk, according with the International Prognostic Scoring System, and 9 patients with myelomonocytic leukemia. Ten healthy donors were included as controls. Acute promyelocytic leukemia-derived NB4 cell line, either untreated or treated with decitabine (DEC) hypomethylating agent, was also analyzed. DNA samples were investigated for Alu methylation level by digestion of genomic DNA with isoschizomers with differential sensitivity to DNA methylation, followed by ddPCR. RESULTS: Using ddPCR, a significant decrease of the global Alu methylation level in DNA extracted from NB4 cells treated with DEC, as compared to untreated cells, was observed. Moreover, comparing the global Alu methylation levels at diagnosis and after azacytidine (AZA) treatment in MDS patients, a statistically significant decrease of Alu sequences methylation after therapy as compared to diagnosis was evident. We also observed a significant decrease of the Alu methylation level in CLL patients compared to HD, and, finally, for CMML patients, a decrease of Alu sequences methylation was observed in patients harboring the SRSF2 hotspot gene mutation c.284C>D. CONCLUSIONS: In our work, we propose a method to investigate Alu differential methylation based on ddPCR technology. This assay introduces ddPCR as a more sensitive and immediate technique for Alu methylation analysis. To date, this is the first application of ddPCR to study DNA repetitive elements. This approach may be useful to profile patients affected by hematologic malignancies for diagnostic/prognostic purpose. FAU - Orsini, Paola"

Clinical features are heterogeneous and although the overall prognosis is poor, survival can vary significantly between individuals. This reflects the need for an individualized treatment approach which incorporates accurate risk stratification. Though numerous prognostic scores exist, newer CMML-specific models incorporating molecular data should be favored. While asymptomatic, low-risk patients should be observed until their disease progresses, the majority of patients will require treatment. Due to a deficiency in treatments with disease-modifying capacity, any patient who requires treatment should be considered for enrollment in clinical trials evaluating novel therapeutic approaches. Allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) remains the only current therapy with the potential to cure the disease and should be considered in most patients with intermediate- to high-risk disease. However, substantial risks are involved and, in part, because of advanced age at diagnosis, a minority of patients are candidates. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have become a preferred treatment approach, and should be used in those with cytopenias. Patients presenting with proliferative features can be treated with hydroxyurea to manage their symptoms and control leukocytosis, though HMAs can be incorporated as well, particularly in patients with higher risk disease. HMAs should also be considered in patients with a high burden of disease prior to proceeding with allo-SCT. Induction chemotherapy should be reserved for younger, healthy patients who have transformed to acute myeloid leukemia to induce remission prior to transplant. Supportive care utilizing transfusion support, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and infection prevention measures should be incorporated into the care of all patients. FAU - Hunter, Anthony M"

    "abstract": "DISEASE OVERVIEW: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder with overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms, with an inherent risk for leukemic transformation ( approximately 15%-20% over 3-5 years). DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on the presence of sustained (>3 months) peripheral blood monocytosis (>/=1 x 10(9) /L; monocytes >/=10%), along with bone marrow dysplasia. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities occur in approximately 30% of patients, while >90% have gene mutations. Mutations involving TET2 ( approximately 60%), SRSF2 ( approximately 50%), ASXL1 ( approximately 40%) and the oncogenic RAS pathway ( approximately 30%) are frequent; while the presence of ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations and the absence of TET2 mutations negatively impact over-all survival. RISK STRATIFICATION: Molecularly integrated prognostic models include; the Groupe Francais des Myelodysplasies (GFM), Mayo Molecular Model (MMM), and the CMML specific prognostic model (CPSS-Mol). Risk factors incorporated into the MMM include presence of nonsense or frameshift ASXL1 mutations, absolute monocyte count > 10 x 10(9) /L, hemoglobin <10 gm/dL, platelet count <100 x 10(9) /L and the presence of circulating immature myeloid cells. The MMM stratifies CMML patients into 4 groups; high (>/=3 risk factors), intermediate-2 (2 risk factors), intermediate-1 (1 risk factor), and low (no risk factors), with median survivals of 16, 31, 59, and 97 months, respectively. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine are commonly used, with overall response rates of approximately 30%-40% and complete remission rates of approximately 7%-17%; with no impact on mutational allele burdens. Allogeneic stem cell transplant is the only potentially curative option, but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "The present study describes a patient with high-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), for whom decitabine therapy achieved partial remission, prior to a sudden transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and an inferior outcome. The 53-year-old male reported easily bruising for 5 months. Examination indicated a diagnosis of CMML. Chromosome analysis identified a 48, XY, +8, +21 karyotype, classifying the patient as high-risk, according to a clinical/molecular CPSS (CPSS-Mol) model. Gene sequencing detected a mutation in DNA methyltransferase 3alpha, which is relatively rarely identified in CMML and has recently been reported to have an independent prognostic impact on overall survival time. Partial remission was achieved with decitabine treatment, and hematologic improvement was observed subsequent to 2 cycles of treatment. However, a sudden transformation to AML led to fatality of the patient. This case suggests that decitabine may be an effective therapeutic for high-risk CMML; however, the response may be temporary, and the ultimate outcome may be extremely poor. Therefore, novel treatment strategies of CMML, including combination therapies with decitabine, or targeted drugs, including Janus kinase inhibitors or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor monoclonal antibodies, require investigation.

Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are active in CMML, but analyses of small series failed to identify mutations predicting response or survival. We analyzed a retrospective multi-center cohort of 174 CMML patients treated with a median of 7 cycles of azacitidine (n = 68) or decitabine (n = 106). Sequencing data before treatment initiation were available for all patients, from Sanger (n = 68) or next generation (n = 106) sequencing. Overall response rate (ORR) was 52%, including complete response (CR) in 28 patients (17%). In multivariate analysis, ASXL1 mutations predicted a lower ORR (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.85, p = 0.037), whereas TET2(mut)/ASXL1(wt) genotype predicted a higher CR rate (OR = 1.18, p = 0.011) independently of clinical parameters. With a median follow-up of 36.7 months, overall survival (OS) was 23.0 months. In multivariate analysis, RUNX1(mut) (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 2.00, p = .011), CBL(mut) (HR = 1.90, p = 0.03) genotypes and higher WBC (log(10)(WBC) HR = 2.30, p = .005) independently predicted worse OS while the TET2(mut)/ASXL1(wt) predicted better OS (HR = 0.60, p = 0.05). CMML-specific scores CPSS and GFM had limited predictive power. Our results stress the need for robust biomarkers of HMA activity in CMML and for novel treatment strategies in patients with myeloproliferative features and RUNX1 mutations."

    "abstract": "RATIONALE: Thrombocytopenia in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is usually attributed to impaired marrow production resulting from cytotoxic drug use or CMML itself (\"CMML-induced thrombocytopenia\"). In very rare cases, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) can be a complication of CMML (\"CMML-associated ITP\"). However, treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in patients with CMML is still a challenge. PATIENT CONCERNS: Case 1 was a 61-year-old female patient admitted to our hospital because of skin petechiae and purpura for 6 days. She had increased monocyte cell count (1.82 x 10/L), markedly decreased platelet count (2 x 10/L), hypercellularity of the megakaryocyte lineage with many immature megakaryocytes, and ZRSR2(zinc finger CCCH-type, RNA binding motif and serine/arginine rich 2) mutation. She failed to the treatment of corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), TPO (thrombopoietin), and cyclosporin A (CsA). Case 2 was a 72-year-old female patient with thrombocytosis and monocytosis for 4 years, and thrombocytopenia for 6 months. After 10 courses of decitabine therapy, she had a persistent severe thrombocytopenia and decreased number of megakaryocytes, TET2 (tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2) and SRSF2 (serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2) mutations were detected. She was dependent on platelet transfusion. DIAGNOSES: Case 1 was diagnosed as CMML-associated ITP, and case 2 as CMML with decitabine therapy-induced thrombocytopenia. INTERVENTIONS: Both patients were treated with eltrombopag. OUTCOMES: In both patients, the platelet counts returned to the normal within 1 week after eltrombopag therapy. The platelet count in case 1 patient remained stable at 141-200 x 10/L for 20 months with stopping therapy for 3 months. In case 2 patient, eltrombopag was stopped 1 month later. Her platelet count decreased to 41 x 10/L, but was stable at approximately 30 x 10/L for 3 months with platelet transfusion independency for 12 months. Both patients had no adverse effects with eltrombopag. LESSONS: CMML-associated ITP is very rare and easily misdiagnosed. To the best of our knowledge, case 1 is the first reported case of the successful treatment of CMML-associated ITP with eltrombopag. Both CMML-associated ITP and decitabine therapy-induced thrombocytopenia in these 2 patients were highly sensitive and safe to eltrombopag therapy. FAU - Gao, Yayue"

We compared the safety and efficacy of low-dose decitabine vs low-dose azacitidine in this group of patients. Adults with low- or intermediate 1-risk MDS or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, were randomly assigned using a Bayesian adaptive design to receive either azacitidine 75 mg/m(2) intravenously/subcutaneously daily or decitabine 20 mg/m(2) intravenously daily for 3 consecutive days on a 28-day cycle. The primary outcome was overall response rate (ORR). Between November 2012 and February 2016, 113 patients were treated: 40 (35%) with azacitidine and 73 (65%) with decitabine. The median age was 70 years; 81% of patients were intermediate 1-risk patients. The median number of cycles received was 9. The ORRs were 70% and 49% (P = .03) for patients treated with decitabine and azacitidine, respectively. Thirty-two percent of patients treated with decitabine became transfusion independent compared with 16% of patients treated with azacitidine (P = .2). Cytogenetic response rates were 61% and 25% (P = .02), respectively. With a median follow-up of 20 months, the overall median event-free survival was 18 months: 20 and 13 months for patients treated with decitabine and azacitidine, respectively (P = .1). Treatment was well tolerated, with a 6-week mortality rate of 0%. The use of low-dose HMAs is safe and effective in patients with lower-risk MDS and MDS/MPN. Their effect on the natural history of lower-risk disease needs to be further studied. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier NCT01720225)."

METHODS: Older adults (age >/= 66 years) who had been diagnosed with CMML from 2001 to 2011 were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, and propensity score matching was used to match patients who had been diagnosed after HMA approval (2007-2011) and had received HMA treatment with patients diagnosed before HMA approval (2001-2003). Cox proportional hazards models with the matched sample were used to assess the change in OS. A second matched cohort of patients who did not receive HMA after approval and patients diagnosed before HMA approval was used to evaluate survival change attributable to other potential differences between the 2 time periods, such as improved supportive care. RESULTS: Among 1378 older adults diagnosed with CMML, the median OS was 13 months, and 18.8% received HMAs. In the primary matched analysis, with 225 HMA users diagnosed in 2007-2011 and 395 patients diagnosed in 2001-2003, the median OS times were 17 and 11 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.91; P = .005). In a secondary analysis, the risk of death did not differ between 395 propensity score-matched HMA nonusers diagnosed in 2007-2011 and 484 patients diagnosed in 2001-2003 (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.91-1.32; P = .34). CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited evidence, HMAs are commonly used to treat older CMML patients. The use of HMAs was associated with a 28% reduction in the risk of death in adjusted analyses. Improvements in supportive care do not appear to account for temporal improvements in OS. Cancer 2017;123:3754-3762. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society."

In this prospective, phase 2 Italian study, CMML patients received intravenous decitabine 20 mg/m(2) per day on Days 1-5 of a 28-day treatment cycle. Response was evaluated after four and six cycles; patients responding at the end of six cycles could continue treatment with decitabine. Forty-three patients were enrolled; >50% were high-risk according to four CMML-specific scoring systems. In the intent-to-treat population (n=42), the overall response rate after six cycles was 47.6%, with seven complete responses (16.6%), eight marrow responses (19%), one partial response (2.4%) and four hematological improvements (9.5%).

Due to the lack of CMML-specific clinical trials, the impact of these agents in the natural history of CMML is not fully understood. We present the largest retrospective series of CMML (n = 151) treated with HMA. Mean age at diagnosis was 69 years (range 50-88). According to the CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS): 17 (15%) were low-risk, 45 (39%) intermediate-1 risk, 42 (36%) intermediate-2, and 12 (10%) high-risk. 35 (23%) patients received single agent azacitidine, 73 (48%) single agent decitabine, and 43 (29%) combinations.

Median overall survival (OS) was 24 months (95%CI: 20-28) and event-free survival 14 months (95%CI: 11-17). By multivariate analysis, age < 70 years, higher levels of hemoglobin, absence of blast in peripheral blood and lower CPSS cytogenetic risk predicted for better OS. CR was significantly higher in those patients treated with decitabine (58.3%) when compared with azacitidine (20.6%) (P < .001). 13 patients (9%) received allo-SCT after a median of 4 cycles of HMA. 66 patients (50%) had HMA failure: 26 primary (34%) and 50 secondary (66%), including 35 (46%) that transformed to AML. Outcomes after HMA failure were poor with OS of 7 months (95%CI: 3-12). In conclusion, HMA are effective in CMML but new agents and combinations are needed.

    "abstract": "Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have been widely used over the last decade, approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The proposed central mechanism of action of HMAs, is the reversal of aberrant methylation in tumor cells, thus reactivating CpG-island promoters and leading to (re)expression of tumor suppressor genes. Recent investigations into the mode of action of azacitidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC) have revealed new molecular mechanisms that impinge on tumor immunity via induction of an interferon response, through activation of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) that are normally epigenetically silenced. Although the global demethylation of DNA by HMAs can induce anti-tumor effects, it can also upregulate the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors and their ligands, resulting in secondary resistance to HMAs. Recent studies have, however, suggested that this could be exploited to prime or (re)sensitize tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies. In recent years, immune checkpoints have been targeted by novel therapies, with the aim of (re)activating the host immune system to specifically eliminate malignant cells. Antibodies blocking checkpoint receptors have been FDA-approved for some solid tumors and a plethora of clinical trials testing these and other checkpoint inhibitors are under way. This review will discuss AZA and DAC novel mechanisms of action resulting from the re-expression of pathologically hypermethylated promoters of gene sets that are related to interferon signaling, antigen presentation and inflammation. We also review new insights into the molecular mechanisms of action of transient, low-dose HMAs on various tumor types and discuss the potential of new treatment options and combinations.

RECENT FINDINGS: CMML is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by peripheral blood monocytosis and myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative alterations in the bone marrow. Clinical behavior of the disease can be heterogeneous, with some patients having an indolent form of the disease, whereas others experience an aggressive course with decreased survival and eventual transformation to leukemia. Multiple studies have helped define the clinical, cytogenetic and mutational prognostic features of the disease. In addition, several prognostic scoring systems have been developed for patients with CMML. Incorporation of mutation data, particularly presence of frameshift and nonsense ASXL1 mutations, into these models seems to be allowing to further improve our ability to predict patient outcomes. SUMMARY: Prognosis of patients with CMML is heterogeneous. Incorporation of mutational data into current clinical prognostic models has allowed to improve our ability to predict patient outcomes. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only potentially curative treatment for patients with CMML but is only an option for a subset of patients. For this reason, hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine have become the backbone of current therapy for patients with CMML, but new therapeutic strategies are required to improve their outcomes.

    "abstract": "Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Diagnosis is based on the presence of persistent (>3 months) peripheral blood monocytosis (>1 x 10(9) /L), along with bone marrow dysplasia. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities occur in approximately 20-30% of patients, while >90% have gene mutations. Mutations involving TET2 ( approximately 60%), SRSF2 ( approximately 50%), ASXL1 ( approximately 40%), and RAS ( approximately 30%) are frequent; with only ASXL1 mutations negatively impacting overall survival. Two molecularly integrated, CMML-specific prognostic models include; the Groupe Francais des Myelodysplasies (GFM) and the Molecular Mayo Model (MMM). The GFM model segregates patients into 3 groups based on: age >65 years, WBC >15 x 10(9) /L, anemia, platelets <100 x 10(9) /L, and ASXL1 mutation status, with respective median survivals of 56 (low), 27.4 (intermediate), and 9.2 (high) months. The MMM is based on ASXL1 mutational status, absolute monocyte count >10 x 10(9) /L, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, platelets <100 x 109/L and circulating immature myeloid cells. This model stratifies patients into four groups; high (>/=3 risk factors), intermediate-2 (2 risk factors), intermediate-1 (1 risk factor) and low (no risk factors), with median survivals of 16, 31, 59, and 97 months, respectively. Hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine are commonly used, with overall response rates of approximately 30-40% and complete remission rates of approximately 7-17%. Allogeneic stem cell transplant is the only potentially curative option, but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Individualized therapy, including epigenetic modifiers and small molecule inhibitors, are exciting prospects. Am. J. Hematol. 91:632-642, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypomethylating drugs are the standard treatment for patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Survival is poor after failure of these drugs; there is no approved second-line therapy. We compared the overall survival of patients receiving rigosertib and best supportive care with that of patients receiving best supportive care only in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes with excess blasts after failure of azacitidine or decitabine treatment. METHODS: We did this randomised controlled trial at 74 hospitals and university medical centres in the USA and Europe. We enrolled patients with diagnosis of refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB)-1, RAEB-2, RAEB-t, or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia based on local site assessment, and treatment failure with a hypomethylating drug in the past 2 years. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive rigosertib 1800 mg per 24 h via 72-h continuous intravenous infusion administered every other week or best supportive care with or without low-dose cytarabine. Randomisation was stratified by pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01241500. FINDINGS: From Dec 13, 2010, to Aug 15, 2013, we enrolled 299 patients: 199 assigned to rigosertib, 100 assigned to best supportive care. Median follow-up was 19.5 months (IQR 11.9-27.3). As of Feb 1, 2014, median overall survival was 8.2 months (95% CI 6.1-10.1) in the rigosertib group and 5.9 months (4.1-9.3) in the best supportive care group (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.67-1.14; p=0.33). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were anaemia (34 [18%] of 184 patients in the rigosertib group vs seven [8%] of 91 patients in the best supportive care group), thrombocytopenia (35 [19%] vs six [7%]), neutropenia (31 [17%] vs seven [8%]), febrile neutropenia (22 [12%] vs ten [11%]), and pneumonia (22 [12%] vs ten [11%]). 41 (22%) of 184 patients in the rigosertib group and 30 (33%) of 91 patients in the best supportive care group died due to adverse events and three deaths were attributed to rigosertib treatment. INTERPRETATION: Rigosertib did not significantly improve overall survival compared with best supportive care. A randomised phase 3 trial of rigosertib (NCT 02562443) is underway in specific subgroups of patients deemed to be at high risk, including patients with very high risk per the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System criteria.

We describe a comprehensive analysis of the mutational landscape of these tumours, combining whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing. We identify an average of 14+/-5 somatic mutations in coding sequences of sorted monocyte DNA and the signatures of three mutational processes. Serial sequencing demonstrates that the response to hypomethylating agents is associated with changes in DNA methylation and gene expression, without any decrease in the mutation allele burden, nor prevention of new genetic alteration occurence. Our findings indicate that cytosine analogues restore a balanced haematopoiesis without decreasing the size of the mutated clone, arguing for a predominantly epigenetic effect. FAU - Merlevede, Jane"

    "abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) offers the possibility of curative therapy for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). However, post-HCT relapse remains a major problem, particularly in patients with high-risk cytogenetics and in patients who cannot tolerate consolidation chemotherapy (eg, due to previous toxicity). We assessed the toxicity and efficacy of 10-day decitabine (Dec), fludarabine (Flu), and 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) as a new conditioning regimen for allogeneic HCT in patients with MDS, CMML, or AML. Thirty patients were enrolled, including 11 with MDS, 2 with CMML, and 17 with AML. Patients received 20 mg/m(2)/day Dec on days -11 to -2, 30 mg/m(2)/day Flu on days -4 to -2, and 2 Gy TBI on day -1, followed by infusion of a donor stem cell graft on day 0. Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporin A and mycophenolate mofetil. At a median follow-up of 443 days, the overall survival was 53%, relapse incidence was 27%, and nonrelapse mortality was 27%. The incidence of severe acute (grade III/IV) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 27%, and that of (predominantly mild) chronic GVHD was 60%. Immunomonitoring studies revealed that specific CD8(+) T cell responses against epigenetically silenced tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), including cancer-testis antigens (MAGE-A1/A2/A3 and PRAME) and RHAMM, occurred more frequently in patients who had received Dec/Flu/TBI conditioning (8 of 11 patients) compared with a control group of patients who had received only Flu/TBI conditioning (2 of 9 patients). In summary, Dec/Flu/TBI conditioning proved feasible and effective and enhanced the induction of TAA-reactive CD8(+) T cell responses in vivo, which may contribute to disease control post-transplantation."

DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are used to treat these disorders, but response is highly variable, with few means to predict which patients will benefit. Here, we examined baseline differences in mutations, DNA methylation, and gene expression in 40 CMML patients who were responsive or resistant to decitabine (DAC) in order to develop a molecular means of predicting response at diagnosis. While somatic mutations did not differentiate responders from nonresponders, we identified 167 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of DNA at baseline that distinguished responders from nonresponders using next-generation sequencing. These DMRs were primarily localized to nonpromoter regions and overlapped with distal regulatory enhancers. Using the methylation profiles, we developed an epigenetic classifier that accurately predicted DAC response at the time of diagnosis. Transcriptional analysis revealed differences in gene expression at diagnosis between responders and nonresponders. In responders, the upregulated genes included those that are associated with the cell cycle, potentially contributing to effective DAC incorporation. Treatment with CXCL4 and CXCL7, which were overexpressed in nonresponders, blocked DAC effects in isolated normal CD34+ and primary CMML cells, suggesting that their upregulation contributes to primary DAC resistance.

Thirty-six consecutive high risk MDS and CMML patients who received decitabine after azacitidine failure were retrospectively reviewed. Response was based on IWG 2006 criteria for MDS and CMML with WBC<13G/l and also included for proliferative CMML the evolution of WBC, splenomegaly (SMG) and extramedullary disease (EMD). Patients received a median number of 3 (range 1-27) cycles of decitabine and 12 patients received at least 6 cycles. Seven (19.4%) patients were responders including 3 marrow CR (mCR), 2 stable disease (SD) with HI-E, 1 SD with HI-N and HI-P and 1 SD with HI-N. In a CMML patient with SD, specific skin lesions resolved with decitabine. Responses were generally short lived (2-5 months) except 1 responder currently ongoing with +11 months follow up. Two non-responders had prolonged SD (without HI) of 21 and 27 months duration respectively. Median OS from onset of decitabine was 7.3 months, without significant difference between responders and non-responders. Treatment with decitabine after azacitidine failure yielded modest ORR (19.4%) with short response duration and poor OS. Thus, use of decitabine in such patients who failed or progressed after azacitidine cannot be recommended, underscoring the need for novel strategies in this setting."

Aberrant upregulation (\u2a7e2-fold) was observed in 34, 14, 15 and 8% of the patients. Increased expression of these four genes was also observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) (N=61). The relative expression of PD-L1 from PBMNC was significantly higher in MDS (P=0.018) and CMML (P=0.0128) compared with AML. By immunohistochemical analysis, PD-L1 protein expression was observed in MDS CD34+ cells, whereas stroma/non-blast cellular compartment was positive for PD-1. In a cohort of patients treated with epigenetic therapy, PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1 and CTLA4 expression was upregulated. Patients resistant to therapy had relative higher increments in gene expression compared with patients who achieved response. Treatment of leukemia cells with decitabine resulted in a dose-dependent upregulation of above genes. Exposure to decitabine resulted in partial demethylation of PD-1 in leukemia cell lines and human samples. This study suggests that PD-1 signaling may be involved in MDS pathogenesis and resistance mechanisms to hypomethylating agents. Blockade of this pathway can be a potential therapy in MDS and AML.

    "abstract": "DISEASE OVERVIEW: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder that is classified as a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm by the 2008 World Health Organization classification of hematopoietic tumors. It is characterized by absolute monocytosis (>1 x 10(9)/L) in the peripheral blood that persists for at least 3 months. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of CMML rests on a combination of morphologic, histopathologic and chromosomal abnormalities in the bone marrow. It is important to exclude other myeloproliferative neoplasms and infectious/autoimmune conditions that can cause monocytosis. RISK STRATIFICATION: Several CMML-specific prognostic models incorporating novel mutations have been recently reported. The Mayo prognostic model classified CMML patients into three risk groups based on: increased absolute monocyte count, presence of circulating blasts, hemoglobin <10 gm/dL and platelets <100 x 10(9)/L. The median survival was 32 months, 18.5 months and 10 months in the low, intermediate, and high-risk groups, respectively. The Groupe Francophone des (GFM) score segregated CMML patients into three risk groups based on: age >65 years, WBC >15 x 10(9)/L, anemia, platelets <100 x 10(9)/L, and ASXL1 mutation status. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, survival ranged from not reached in the low-risk group to 14.4 months in the high-risk group. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: The Food and Drug Administration has approved azacitidine and decitabine for the treatment of patients with CMML. An allogeneic stem cell transplant can potentially offer a curative option to a subset of CMML patients. It is hoped that with the discovery of several novel mutations, targeted therapies will become available in the near future."

Patients may present with symptoms related to cytopenias and/or an underlying hypercatabolic state with drenching night sweats, splenomegaly, and weight loss. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of CMML rests on a combination of morphologic, histopathologic, and chromosomal abnormalities in the bone marrow, after careful exclusion of other conditions (both malignant and nonmalignant) that can cause monocytosis. Numerous molecular abnormalities have been recently recognized in patients with CMML-unfortunately, no single pathognomonic finding specific to CMML has been identified thus far. RISK STRATIFICATION: The International Prognostic Scoring System for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cannot be used to risk stratify patients with CMML because this model excluded patients with a leukocyte count >12 x 10(9) L(-1) . Other risk stratification models such as the MD Anderson prognostic score and Dusseldorf score have been published. In the only model that took karyotype into account, bone marrow blasts >/= 10%, leukocyte count >/= 13 x 10(9) L(-1) , hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, platelet count < 100 x 10(9) L(-1) , and presence of trisomy 8, abnormalities of chromosome 7, or complex karyotype were found to be independent predictors of adverse survival. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: The Food and Drug Administration has approved azacitidine and decitabine for the treatment of patients with CMML based on two pivotal trials in MDS. Novel classes of agents including immunomodulatory drugs, nucleoside analogs, and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being investigated in the treatment of CMML. With the advent of reduced intensity conditioning, an allogeneic stem cell transplant has also become a viable option for a subset of patients."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Sweet's syndrome (also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) in two patients receiving azacitidine therapy is reported. SUMMARY: The development of Sweet's syndrome in association with azacitidine use is rare (three published case reports since the drug's U.S. marketing approval in 2004), and the syndrome is not listed as a potential adverse reaction in the product packaging. In one of two cases of probable azacitidine-related Sweet's syndrome reported here, a 64-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) developed a severe erythematous and nodular rash with peeling on his arms, legs, and face after receiving the drug (75 mg/m(2) subcutaneously daily) for three days; the second case involved a 67-year-old man with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who experienced a similar skin rash, as well as chills and an elevated body temperature, after five days of treatment with azacitidine. In both cases, the results of dermatologic or pathologic examination and skin biopsies were consistent with Sweet's syndrome. Perhaps the strongest evidence of a drug-induced etiology in these cases was the close temporal relationship between the initiation of azacitidine use and the development of Sweet's syndrome, with prompt symptom resolution after the discontinuation of azacitidine use and administration of appropriate corticosteroid therapy. CONCLUSION: Azacitidine was the apparent cause of Sweet's syndrome in a patient with MDS and another with CMML. Both responded well to corticosteroid therapy. After resolution of the reaction, decitabine was given to the first patient and azacitidine to the second, without complications. FAU - Trickett, Hannah B"

Overall response rate was 38% with 4 complete responses (10%), 8 marrow responses (21%), and 3 stable diseases with hematologic improvement (8%). Eighteen patients (46%) demonstrated stable disease without hematologic improvement, and 6 (15%) progressed to acute leukemia.

Lower CJUN and CMYB gene expression levels independently predicted improved overall survival. This trial confirmed DAC efficacy in approximately 40% of CMML patients with advanced myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic features and suggested that CJUN and CMYB expression could be potential biomarkers in this setting.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypomethylating drugs are useful in the management of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Two of these drugs, azacitidine and decitabine, have received FDA approval for the treatment of MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). However, phase 2 and 3 studies that assessed these agents in MDS included only a small number of patients with CMML. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azacitidine in the treatment of CMML. METHODS: The records of thirty-eight patients diagnosed with CMML and treated with azacitidine at our institution were reviewed. Azacitidine was administered at 75 mg/m(2) /day for 7 days or 100 mg/m(2) /day for 5 days every 4 weeks. Patients who received at least 1 cycle of the drug were considered evaluable for response. RESULTS: Response was assessed by the modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria. The overall response rate was 39% (14 of 36); complete response (CR) rate was 11% (4 of 36); partial response (PR) rate was 3% (1 of 36); hematologic improvement (HI) was 25% (9 of 36). The median overall survival was 12 months. There was a statistically significant overall survival advantage in responders compared with nonresponders: 15.5 months versus 9 months, respectively (P = .04). Treatment was generally well tolerated. One of 2 patients had complete resolution of a skin rash that was due to monocytic infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Azacitidine is active in the treatment of CMML. The therapy-associated toxicity is acceptable. Our results support further investigation of azacitidine in CMML, particularly in combination with other agents."

However, how TIF1gamma regulates the development of different blood cell lineages and whether TIF1gamma is involved in human hematological malignancies remain to be determined. Here we have shown that TIF1gamma was a tumor suppressor in mouse and human chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Loss of Tif1g in mouse HSCs favored the expansion of the granulo-monocytic progenitor compartment. Furthermore, Tif1g deletion induced the age-dependent appearance of a cell-autonomous myeloproliferative disorder in mice that recapitulated essential characteristics of human CMML. TIF1gamma was almost undetectable in leukemic cells of 35% of CMML patients. This downregulation was related to the hypermethylation of CpG sequences and specific histone modifications in the gene promoter. A demethylating agent restored the normal epigenetic status of the TIF1G promoter in human cells, which correlated with a reestablishment of TIF1gamma expression. Together, these results demonstrate that TIF1G is an epigenetically regulated tumor suppressor gene in hematopoietic cells and suggest that changes in TIF1gamma expression may be a biomarker of response to demethylating agents in CMML.

The most frequent of these diseases in chronic myelo-monocytic leukemia, a disease of elderly people that has long been associated with myelodysplastic syndromes in biological studies as well as in clinical trials. The recent identification of a number of genetic mutations in the leukemic clone, including frequent mutations in TET2, ASXL1 and RUNX1, less frequent mutations in NRAS, KRAS and C-CBL, and rare mutations in JAK2, FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, and EZHR2 may improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. Patient care depends on the disease risk, especially the percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow, the age and the performance status. Supportive care is required in all patients. In high risk patients, the only curative therapeutic is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which is rarely feasible due to the age of the patients and the absence of donor. Demethylating agents such as azacitidine and decitabine are currently the most efficient drugs. The prognosis remains poor, with a median survival lower than 24 months. FAU - Solary, Eric"

The median number of administered cycles was 3. Most patients (39; 95%) received a standard dose of the drugs at the initiation of therapy. Nine patients (22%) required treatment interruptions or discontinuation, and 10 patients (24%) required dose reductions. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 63%, and 4 patients (10%) achieved a complete response. Twenty patients (51%) experienced grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression-related toxicities. Hospitalization was required in 68% of the patients. Among 12 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 29 mL per minute or less, 6 required dose reductions attributable to myelosuppression (n = 3) or to worsening renal function (n = 3). The overall survival (OS) at 18 months was 12%, and the median OS was 8.6 months. CONCLUSION: The use of HA in patients with RI is feasible, but is associated with a higher incidence of toxicity.

Patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia were first screened for JAK2 and NPM1 mutations, and 3 patients with mutations were identified. Mutant allele percentages in mononuclear cell DNA were followed after treatment, along with methylation of LINE1 and 10 other genes. The clearance of mutant alleles was modest after the first cycle, despite induction of hypomethylation. Delayed substantial clearance was observed after 2 to 4 cycles that correlated with clinical response. Two patients had complete disappearance of mutant alleles and sustained clinical remissions.

Recent reclassification of CMML as a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative (MDS/MPS) disease rather than a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by the World Health Organisation (WHO) has led to a review of CMML patients treated with decitabine. Overall response rates (ORR) (complete response [CR]+partial response [PR]) in the subset of patients with CMML in one pivotal phase 3 trial (D-0007) and two phase 2 trials (PCH 95-11, PCH 97-19) decitabine were reviewed. For consistency across trials, all decitabine-treated patients were evaluated using the phase 2 response criteria (CR was defined by normocellular bone marrow with <5% blasts and normal Hgb, WBC, and platelet counts, and PR required 50% decrease in blast count, increases in Hgb by >1.5 mmol/L, WBC count by >1000, and platelet count by >50,000). A total of 31 patients diagnosed with CMML are included in this review. Similar demographics and disease characteristics were observed in all three studies, with an average age of 70.2 years and 71% of patients male. Baseline WBC of >20,000 were observed in 8/28 (29%) patients and baseline bone marrow blasts >5% in 11/28 (39%) patients. All clinical responses were centrally reviewed. The ORR was 25% (14% CR+11% PR). Hematologic improvement was observed in 11% of patients and stable disease in 39% of patients. The decitabine adverse event profile seen in CMML patients was similar to observations in other hematologic patient populations, with myelosuppression and related infectious complications. These data demonstrate encouraging activity for decitabine in CMML, and suggest that studies in other myeloproliferative diseases may be warranted. FAU - Wijermans, P W"

Paradoxically, genome-wide DNA hypomethylation may also play a causal role in carcinogenesis by inducing chromosomal instability and spurious gene expression. Since methylation does not alter DNA base sequence, much attention has been focused recently on developing small molecule inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases that can potentially be used as anticancer agents. Vidaza (5-azacytidine), marketed by Pharmion (Boulder, CO, USA), was the first DNA methyltransferase inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for chemotherapy against myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a heterogeneous bone marrow disorder. Recently MGI Pharma Inc. (Bloomington, MN, USA) got FDA approval to market Dacogen (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, or decitabine) for treating MDS patients. These drugs were used earlier against certain anemias to induce expression of fetal globin genes. Interest in clinical trials of these drugs as anticancer agents has been renewed only recently because of reversal of methylation-mediated silencing of critical genes in cancer. Clinical trials have shown that both drugs have therapeutic potential against leukemia such as MDS, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. In contrast, their effectiveness with solid tumors appears to be less promising, which challenges researchers to develop inhibitors with more efficacy and less toxicity. The major hindrance of their usage as anticancer agents is their instability in vivo as well as the toxicity secondary to their excessive incorporation into DNA, which causes cell cycle arrest. Gene expression profiling in cancer cells revealed that antineoplastic property of these drugs is mediated through both methylation-dependent and -independent pathways. Recently, we have shown that treatment of cancer cells with these cytidine analogues also induces proteasomal degradation of DNA methyltransferase 1, the ubiquitously expressed enzyme upregulated in almost all cancer cells. Development of related stable drugs that can facilitate gene activation in cancer cells by enhancing degradation of DNA methyltransferases without being incorporated into DNA would be ideal for chemotherapy. In this monograph we review historical perspective and recent advances on the molecular mechanisms of action and clinical applications of these DNA hypomethylating agents. FAU - Ghoshal, Kalpana"

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Decitabine, a hypomethylating agent, is active and has been approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Intensive chemotherapy is an accepted form of therapy for patients with higher risk MDS. The comparative efficacy of these 2 forms of treatment in MDS is unknown. The objective of the current study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity profiles of decitabine and intensive chemotherapy in MDS. METHODS: The authors compared lower intensity decitabine therapy (n = 115 patients) with intensive chemotherapy (as it is used in acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) in patients with higher risk MDS. Two comparisons were made with a cohort of 376 historic patients (from 1995 to 2005): The first comparison included a subcohort of 115 patients (Group A) who matched the 115 decitabine study patients according to age, International Prognostic Scoring System, and cytogenetics; and the second comparison included the whole cohort of 376 patients without matching (Group B). A multivariate analysis was performed for outcome. RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rate according to AML criteria was 43% with decitabine, 46% with intensive chemotherapy in Group A, and 52% with intensive chemotherapy in Group B. Compared with Group A, mortality at 6 weeks was 3% with decitabine versus 13% with intensive chemotherapy (P = .006) and, at 3 months, 7% with decitabine versus 23% with intensive chemotherapy (P = .001). Survival was better with decitabine versus intensive chemotherapy in Group A (median survival: 22 months vs 12 months; P < .001). A multivariate analysis of survival in all 491 patients who received decitabine or intensive chemotherapy (Group B) selected decitabine as an independent, favorable prognostic factor for survival (P = .006; hazard ratio, 0.74) after accounting for the independent prognostic effect of pretreatment factors. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, decitabine was associated with a survival advantage compared with intensive chemotherapy in patients with higher risk MDS. Future studies should evaluate prospectively the results of decitabine versus intensive chemotherapy in this setting. FAU - Kantarjian, Hagop M"

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation can be curative, but only a small subset of patients are eligible for transplantation, and until recently there were few options other than supportive care for transplant-ineligible patients. Since 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved three new therapies specifically for the indication of MDS: two DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (azacitidine and decitabine) and an immunomodulatory agent (lenalidomide). Several other drugs are used by clinicians for treatment of patients with MDS, but are not specifically FDA-approved for this indication. With several therapeutic options available, yet none of them effective in the majority of cases, it can be challenging for clinicians to choose the most appropriate treatment for an individual patient. Here we discuss a risk-based management approach to MDS that incorporates recent data regarding these new therapies. While many questions remain about the optimal use of newer agents, the long-standing perception of MDS as a syndrome where therapeutic nihilism is the only realistic approach is slowly beginning to change.

In this study, the authors update their experience with decitabine in patients with MDS and analyze the cytogenetic response patterns and prognostic factors associated with decitabine therapy. METHODS: One hundred fifteen patients with higher risk MDS who received treatment with decitabine were reviewed. Patients received decitabine 100 mg/m(2) per course every 4 weeks in 3 different schedules: 1) 20 mg/m(2) intravenously daily x 5, 2) 20 mg/m(2) subcutaneously daily x 5, and 3) 10 mg/m(2) intravenously daily x 10. Decitabine was given for a median of >or=7 courses (range, 1-23 courses). RESULTS: Overall, 80 patients (70%) achieved a response according to the modified International Working Group criteria (IWG): complete response (CR), 40 patients (35%); partial response, 2 patients (2%); bone marrow CR with or without other hematologic improvements (HI), 26 patients (23%); and other HI, 12 patients (10%).

In a multivariate analysis, poor prognostic factors for achieving IWG CR were MDS (vs chronic myelomonocytic leukemia), longer duration of MDS, and prior MDS therapy. For survival, independent adverse prognostic factors were chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities, older age, and prior MDS therapy (excluding growth factors). CONCLUSIONS: The longer term experience with decitabine in MDS was favorable. Pretreatment prognostic factors may predict the outcome of patients who receive decitabine therapy for MDS.

We examined the incidence and kinetics of cytogenetic responses to decitabine in these patients. Of 115 successfully karyotyped patients, 61 (53%) had clonal chromosomal abnormalities prior to treatment.

Median duration of cytogenetic responses was 7.5 months (range, 3-15). Analysis of response by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) cytogenetic risk groups revealed three out of five cytogenetic responses (60%) in the IPSS 'low-risk' group, 6 out of 30 with 'intermediate risk' (20%) and 10 out of 26 in the 'high-risk' group (38%).

The relative risk of death in patients achieving a major cytogenetic response was 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.88) compared with patients in whom the cytogenetically abnormal clone persisted (P = 0.0213). In conclusion, repeated courses of low-dose decitabine induce cytogenetic remissions in a substantial number of elderly MDS patients with pre-existing chromosomal abnormalties; these are associated with improved survival compared with patients in whom the cytogenetically abnormal clone persists. Patients with 'high-risk' chromosomal abnormalities may particularly benefit from this treatment. FAU - Lubbert, M"

    "abstract": "The activity of topotecan was evaluated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Sixty patients with a diagnosis of MDS (n = 30) or CMML (n = 30) were treated. Their median age was 66 years, with 50 patients (83%) being over 60 years of age at time of study entry. Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 50% of patients and thrombocytopenia of less than 50 x 10(9)/L in 50%. Topotecan was administered as 2 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for five days (10 mg/m2 per course) every 4 to 6 weeks for two courses, then at maximum tolerated dose level (1-2 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for five days) once every 4-8 weeks for a maximum of 12 courses. Evaluation of outcome and of differences among subgroups was performed according to standard methods; the criteria for response were those used for acute leukemia. Nineteen patients (31%) achieved a complete response (CR). A CR was achieved in 11 of 30 patients with MDS (37%) and in eight of 30 with CMML (27%). A CR was achieved in 10 of 23 patients with previously untreated MDS (43%). Eight of 11 patients who presented with cytogenetic abnormalities (five of which involved chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities) and achieved CR, were evaluated cytogenetically in CR: all were cytogenetically normal in CR. Characteristics associated with a higher CR rate were lack of previous chemotherapy, absence of ras oncogene mutations, and presence of less than 10% monocytes in either peripheral blood or bone marrow. In contrast, CR rates were similar by different agent groups, by different karyotype abnormalities, and by other pre-therapy peripheral blood counts. Non-myelosuppressive side effects were mucositis in 67% of patients (severe [grade 3-4] 23%), diarrhea in 38% (severe 17%), and nausea and vomiting in 28% (severe 5%). Febrile episodes during neutropenia occurred in 85% of patients and documented infections in 47 %. Mortality in the first four weeks was 20%. With a median follow-up duration of 31 months, the 12 month survival rate was 38%, median survival time 10.5 months, and median remission duration 7.5 months. In summary, topotecan has significant single-agent activity in MDS and CMML. Complete responses associated with topotecan therapy often involve the disappearance of abnormal, poor-prognosis karyotypes, which is particularly encouraging. Future strategies to optimize topotecan's role include combination regimens with topoisomerase II reactive agents, cytarabine, or hypomethylating agents (azacytidine and decitabine). FAU - Beran, M"

    "abstract": "There is no standard therapy for elderly patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The treatment options of low-dose Ara-C and haematopoietic growth factors are disappointing in regard to response rate or response duration. We tested the treatment with a 72-h continuous infusion of low-dose 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) in a group of 29 elderly patients with high-risk MDS. In 15 patients (54%) we observed a response. Eight complete responses were reached, even among patients with bad prognostic cytogenetic findings. The actuarial median survival from the start of the therapy was 46 weeks. The only (and major) toxicity was myelosuppression, leading to a prolonged cytopenic period and thus leading to five toxic deaths (17%) in this high-risk patient group. We conclude that DAC is an effective drug in the treatment of MDS patients and that it probably works via its cytotoxic activity. Myelotoxicity is its major adverse effect. FAU - Wijermans, P W"
