    "abstract": "Enasidenib is an oral IDH2 inhibitor that reduces the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, differentiating IDH2 mutated leukemic cells with initial promising results for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. We performed a retrospective study in Spain evaluating enasidenib in patients diagnosed with IDH2-mutated myeloid neoplasms (AML, MDS, myeloid sarcoma and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Twenty-three patients were included, with 20 having a refractory/relapsed (R/R) disease status. The median age was 73 years, and the majority patients were classified as adverse risk by the European LeukemiaNet 2022 criteria. The most frequent mutation was IDH2 R140 (69.6%), while 30.4% had R172 mutation. Enasidenib was administered as a single agent in 18 patients, in combination with azacitidine in four patients, and with low-dose cytarabine in another one. The median number of cycles administered was four, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 39.1% and a morphological complete remission (CR) rate of 26.1%. Median overall survival (OS) was 8.3 months. Patients who achieved a complete response had a better outcome than the rest of the patients in terms of OS (19.8 months (95%CI: 15.7-NR) vs. 4.2 (95%CI: 1.5-NR), p\u2009=\u20090.01). Drug-related events included leukocytosis in five patients (21.7%), hyperbilirubinemia in six patients (26.1%) and differentiation syndrome (DS) in four patients (17.4%), including one grade 3 DS and one death related to this latter adverse event (AE), similar to previous findings. Although enasidenib failed to demonstrate a clear overall survival advantage in phase 3 trials, the extended responses and long-term survivors observed herein underscore its therapeutic potential. Ultimately, our data support enasidenib's role as a targeted therapy for IDH2-mutated AML, indicating that expanded access to this agent is warranted to optimize outcomes in these challenging patient populations, especially for R/R AML patients.",

    "abstract": "Atraumatic splenic rupture (ASR) is rare and typically attributed to underlying pathological conditions, with neoplastic diseases being the main etiologies. Traditionally, surgical intervention has been the standard approach for managing ASR in the majority of patients. However, reports on the outcomes of conservative management, especially for ASR related to myeloid neoplasms, are scarce. Here, we present two case reports involving ASR associated with myeloid neoplasms. The first patient, suffering from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) harboring CBL and ASXL1 mutations, developed ASR shortly after receiving treatment with the hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine. The second patient, in the blast phase of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), experienced ASR during the progression of their disease. In the initial case, despite experiencing intense abdominal pain and hypovolemic shock, the patient responded favorably to prompt fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion upon, thanks to a timely diagnosis. A non-operative management approach successfully averted the need for splenectomy or arterial embolism, leading to a favorable outcome. In the second case, the patient presented with progressive abdominal pain but remained hemodynamic stability throughout the ASR episode. We opted for a cautious approach, prioritizing resuscitation, close monitoring, and a watchful waiting strategy. Regrettably, the patient's condition deteriorated, marked by increasing splenomegaly, unchecked leukocytosis, and recurrent parenchymal hemorrhages. Here, we report two cases of ASR in myeloid neoplasms, demonstrating that patients may achieve acceptable outcomes with conservative management.",

The combination of hypomethylating agents with venetoclax (Ven) has demonstrated promising results in these diseases, although randomized clinical trials are needed for validation. In this retrospective study, we compared two matched cohorts of patients with MDS or CMML: one receiving oral decitabine-cedazuridine (DEC-C, n\u2009=\u200973) and one receiving DEC-C and Ven (DEC-C-Ven, n\u2009=\u200951), in three contemporary clinical trials. The aim is to determine the impact of the addition of Ven to HMA in MDS and CMML. Individuals were matched using a propensity score approach that was based on the IPSS-M score and age. All patients had excess blasts; 84% were diagnosed with MDS and 16% with CMML. Most patients had high- or very high-risk disease, according to the revised IPSS-R. The overall response rate was superior in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (90% vs 64%, P\u2009=\u20090.002).

Although epigenetic mechanisms are assumed, responding patients' epigenomes have not been thoroughly examined. We aimed to clarify HbF kinetics and prognostic value for azacytidine treated patients, as well as the epigenetic landscape that might influence HbF re-expression and its clinical relevance. Serial HbF measurements by high-performance liquid chromatography (n\u2009=\u200920) showed induction of HbF only among responders (p\u2009=\u20090.030). Moreover, HbF increase immediately after the first azacytidine cycle demonstrated prognostic value for progression-free survival (PFS) (p\u2009=\u20090.032, HR\u2009=\u20090.19, CI 0.24-1.63).

More recently, the true nature of the myeloid cells present in the cutaneous infiltrates of this theoretically reactive dermatitis is being clarified with the use of new molecular techniques such as next-generation sequencing. The same mutations in bone marrow (BM) myeloid neoplastic cells and in the cells of cutaneous infiltrates have been found. We present the case of a 77-year-old man who presented with spread and treatment-resistant skin granulomatous lesions previous to the diagnosis of CMML. The same clonal mutations in SRSF2, IDH1, and RUNX1 were found in both skin and BM with resolution of the lesions after the initiation of azacytidine. In conclusion, we report an exceptional case in which specific granulomatous cutaneous lesions have preceded and allowed the earlier diagnosis of an underlying CMML and a review of all previous similar cases in the literature, including molecular alterations.",

Our case report explores the rare coexistence of CMML with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in a 63-year-old female patient. CMML diagnosis followed World Health Organization criteria, and the patient was classified as having high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-CMML stage 2. Initial treatment with subcutaneous azacytidine for CMML proved partially effective, highlighting persistent severe thrombocytopenia. Subsequent investigations revealed secondary ITP associated with Crohn's disease. Conventional ITP therapies, including high-dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin, showed limited efficacy. Eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, was initiated, resulting in the normalization of platelet counts within six weeks. Our case emphasizes the diagnostic challenges and intricate treatment landscape of CMML-associated ITP, suggesting eltrombopag as a potential therapeutic option in refractory cases.

The hedgehog (HH) pathway is one of the main pathways for cancer stem cells survival and several HH inhibitors (HHi) are approved in clinical practice. Sonidegib (SON), an oral HHi, was tested in this phase 1/1b trial in combination with azacitidine (AZA, 75 mg/m Sixty-two patients (28 [45%] newly diagnosed) were treated in this study, including 10 patients in the dose-finding component and 52 patients in phase 1b. SON 200 mg oral daily on days 1-28 each cycle was deemed the recommended dose for phase 1b. Out of 21 rrAML patients, two achieved response (one complete response/one morphologic leukemia-free state) with no responses seen in seven r/r MDS/CMML patients. In newly diagnosed AML/MDS, response was seen in six (three had complete remission, two had morphological leukemia-free status) of 27 patients. Median overall survival was 26.4 and 4.7 months for newly diagnosed MDS and AML, respectively. Safety was satisfactory with common (>20%) side effects including fatigue, constipation, nausea, cough, insomnia, and diarrhea. Only 7% of patients died in the study, and none of the deaths were deemed related to treatment. Our study shows that AZA + SON are a safe combination in a patient with MN.

Hence, we aimed to reveal the frequence of infections, predisposing factors of infection and to analyse infection attributable mortality in patients with high-risk MDS, CMML and AML who received hypomethylating agents in our center where routine infection prophylaxis is not applied. 43 adult patients with AML or high-risk MDS or CMML who received HMA \u2265\u00a02 consecutive cycles from January 2014 to December 2020 were enrolled in the study. 43 patients and 173 treatment cycles were analyzed.

The only approved disease-modifying therapies for any of the MDS/MPN are DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) for patients with dysplastic CMML, and still, outcomes are generally poor, making this an important area of unmet clinical need. Due to both the rarity and the heterogeneous nature of MDS/MPN, they have been challenging to study in dedicated prospective studies. Thus, refining first-line treatment strategies has been difficult, and optimal salvage treatments following DNMTi failure have also not been rigorously studied. ABNL-MARRO (A Basket study of Novel therapy for untreated MDS/MPN and Relapsed/Refractory Overlap Syndromes) is an international cooperation that leverages the expertise of the MDS/MPN International Working Group (IWG) and provides the framework for collaborative studies to advance treatment of MDS/MPN and to explore clinical and pathologic markers of disease severity, prognosis, and treatment response. ABNL MARRO 001 (AM-001) is an open label, randomly allocated phase 1/2 study that will test novel treatment combinations in MDS/MPNs, beginning with the novel targeted agent itacitinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor, combined with ASTX727, a fixed dose oral combination of the DNMTi decitabine and the cytidine deaminase inhibitor cedazuridine to improve decitabine bioavailability. Beyond the primary objectives of the study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel treatment combinations in MDS/MPN, the study will (i) Establish the ABNL MARRO infrastructure for future prospective studies, (ii) Forge innovative scientific research that will improve our understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms of disease, and (iii) Inform the clinical application of diagnostic criteria, risk stratification and prognostication tools, as well as response assessments in this heterogeneous patient population.

    "abstract": "Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder with overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Median overall survival of this aggressive myeloid malignancy is only 2-3 years, with a 15-30% risk of acute leukemic transformation. The paucity of clinical trials specifically designed for CMML has made therapeutic management of CMML patients challenging. As a result, treatment paradigms for CMML patients are largely borrowed from MDS and MPN. The standard of care still relies on hydroxyurea, hypomethylating agents (HMA), and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, this latter option remaining the only potentially curative therapy. To date, approved drugs for CMML treatment are HMA, including azacitidine, decitabine, and more recently the oral combination of decitabine and cedazuridine. However, HMA treatment does not meaningfully alter the natural course of this disease. New treatment approaches for improving CMML-associated cytopenias or targeting the CMML malignant clone are emerging. More than 25 therapeutic agents are currently being evaluated in phase 1 or phase 2 clinical trials for CMML and other myeloid malignancies, often in combination with a HMA backbone. Several novel agents, such as sotatercept, ruxolitinib, lenzilumab, and tagraxofusp have shown promising clinical efficacy in CMML. Current evidence supports the idea that effective treatment in CMML will likely require combination therapy targeting multiple pathways, which emphasizes the need for additional new therapeutic options. This review focuses on recent therapeutic advances and innovative treatment strategies in CMML, including global and molecularly targeted approaches.

Preclinical work demonstrated a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile approximate to parenteral decitabine, leading to early-phase clinical trials of oral cedazuridine-decitabine (C-DEC) in myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). A combination of oral decitabine 35 mg with oral cedazuridine 100 mg was established as the recommended phase 2 dose.

Complex disease biology has posed significant challenge to the development of novel therapeutics. Despite myriad clinical trials, none have been superior to azacitidine and decitabine (DEC) therapy. These therapies present a substantial burden for patients with 5 and 7\u00a0days of parenteral treatment in an infusion clinic. To overcome this limitation, a fixed drug combination of oral DEC-cedazuridine (C-DEC), a cytidine deaminase inhibitor with documented safety profile was developed. This drug was recently approved by the US FDA, Australian TGA and Health Canada for newly diagnosed or previously treated intermediate or high risk by international prognostic scoring system, MDS and CMML.

All available cohort studies of patients with CMML treated with decitabine and azacitidine were identified. The primary endpoints of this meta-analysis were response to hypomethylating agents. Pooled estimates of treatment response and drug-related adverse events were calculated using fixed or random effect models. Fourteen studies with 600 CMML patients (decitabine: n=196; azacitidine: n=404) were identified and included for meta-analysis. HMAs yielded a pooled ORR estimate of 43% (95% CI: 36%-50%) in patients with CMML. Patients received either azacitidine or decitabine exhibited comparable incidence of ORR (43% vs. 45%, P=0.810), while significantly higher incidence of mCR was observed in patients treated with decitabine (23% vs. 10%, P=0.000). Decitabine treatment was also associated with higher incidence of transfusion independence (42% vs. 20%, P=0.044). Both HMAs led to objective hematologic or non-hematologic AEs (27%-43%), while dosage modification/delay were more frequent in patients treated with azacitidine (81% vs. 67%, P=0.021). This current study may provide preliminary data in evaluating the efficacy and safety of HMAs in patients with CMML. Decitabine and azacitidine are comparable effective and safe in treating CMML.

We aimed to investigate whether hypomethylating agents provide a benefit in subgroups of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia compared with other treatments. For this retrospective cohort study, data were retrieved between Nov 30, 2017, and Jan 5, 2019, from 38 centres in the USA and Europe. We included non-selected, consecutive patients diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, who received chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia-directed therapy. Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia according to 2016 WHO criteria at initial diagnosis (ie, \u226520% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood) or with unavailability of treatment data were excluded. Outcomes assessed included overall survival, time to next treatment, and time to transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia. Analyses were adjusted by age, sex, platelet count, and Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia-Specific Prognostic Scoring System (CPSS). Patients were grouped by first received treatment with either hydroxyurea, hypomethylating agents, or intensive chemotherapy, and stratified by risk according to blast count, French-American-British subtype, CPSS, WHO 2016 subtype, and the eligibility criteria of the DACOTA trial (NCT02214407). 949 patients diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia between April 13, 1981, and Oct 26, 2018, were included. Median follow-up was 23\u00b74 months (IQR 11\u00b75-42\u00b73) from diagnosis and 16\u00b72 months (6\u00b76-31\u00b76) from start of first-line treatment. 412 (43%) of 949 patients received hypomethylating agents as first treatment, 391 (41%) hydroxyurea, and 83 (9%) intensive chemotherapy.

In patients with myeloproliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (myeloproliferative CMML), median overall survival was 12\u00b76 months (10\u00b77-15\u00b70) versus 17\u00b76 months (14\u00b78-21\u00b75; HR 1\u00b738 [1\u00b712-1\u00b770]; p=0\u00b70027) for patients treated with hydroxyurea versus hypomethylating agents, and 12\u00b73 months (8\u00b74-16\u00b76) versus 17\u00b76 months (14\u00b78-21\u00b75; HR 1\u00b744 [1\u00b702-2\u00b703]; p=0\u00b7040) for intensive chemotherapy versus hypomethylating agents. Hypomethylating agents did not confer an overall survival advantage for patients classified as having lower-risk disease (ie, myelodysplastic chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia with <10% blasts, CMML-0, or lower-risk CPSS). These data suggest hypomethylating agents as the preferred therapy for patients with higher-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and those with myeloproliferative CMML. Our findings also suggest that CPSS is a valuable tool to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from hypomethylating agents. Further evidence from prospective cohorts would be desirable.

To support Asia-inclusive global development, we applied multiregional clinical trial (MRCT) principles of the International Conference on Harmonisation E17 guidelines by evaluating similarity in drug-related and disease-related intrinsic and extrinsic factors. A PubMed literature review (January 2000-November 2019) supported similarity in epidemiology of higher-risk MDS, AML, and CMML in Western and East Asian populations. Furthermore, the treatment of MDS/AML was similar in both East Asian and Western regions, with the same dose of azacitidine being the standard of care. Median overall survival in MDS following azacitidine treatment was generally comparable across regions, and the types and frequencies of molecular alterations in AML and MDS were comparable. Dose-escalation studies established the same maximum tolerated dose of pevonedistat in combination with azacitidine in Western and East Asian populations. Pevonedistat clearance was similar across races. Taken together, conservation of drug-related and disease-related intrinsic and extrinsic factors supported design of an Asia-inclusive Phase 3 trial and a pooled East Asian region. A sample size of ~\u00a030 East Asian patients (of ~\u00a0450 randomized) was estimated as needed to demonstrate consistency in efficacy relative to the global population. This analysis is presented as an exemplar to illustrate application of clinical pharmacology and translational science principles in designing Asia-inclusive MRCTs. Study Highlights WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? Azacitidine is the standard of care for myelodysplastic syndromes/low-blast acute myeloid leukemia (AML) across Western and East Asian patients. The first-in-class small-molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme, pevonedistat, has been investigated as a single agent in multiple studies of hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies and in combination with azacitidine in elderly patients with untreated AML. WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS? By applying clinical pharmacology and translational science and International Conference on Harmonisation E17 principles, this study designed an East Asian-inclusive global pivotal Phase 3 trial of pevonedistat, taking into consideration drug-related and disease-related intrinsic and extrinsic factors. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE? These analyses provide scientific rationale for Asia-inclusive globalization of the pivotal, Phase 3 PANTHER trial and for pooling clinical data across the East Asian region for assessing consistency in efficacy. HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE? We developed a framework to facilitate efficient global clinical development of investigational therapies for rare cancers and orphan diseases in Asia-inclusive multiregional clinical trials.",

Using lentiviral expression of MN1 for oncogenic supplementation and transplanting transduced primary mononuclear CMML cells into immunocompromised mice, we established three serially transplantable CMML-PDX models with disease-related gene mutations that recapitulate the disease in vivo. Ectopic MN1 expression was confirmed to enhance the proliferation of CMML cells, which otherwise did not engraft upon secondary transplantation. Furthermore, MN1-supplemented CMML cells were serially transplantable into recipient mice up to 5 generations. This robust engraftment enabled an in vivo RNA interference screening targeting CMML-related mutated genes including NRAS, confirming that their functional relevance is preserved in the presence of MN1. The novel combination treatment with azacitidine and the MEK-inhibitor trametinib additively inhibited ERK-phosphorylation and thus depleted the signal from mutated NRAS. The combination treatment significantly prolonged survival of CMML mice compared to single-agent treatment. Thus, we identified the combination of azacitidine and trametinib as an effective treatment in NRAS-mutated CMML and propose its clinical development.",

    "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are characterised by abnormal epigenetic repression and differentiation of bone marrow haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Drugs that reverse epigenetic repression, such as 5-azacytidine (5-AZA), induce haematological improvement in half of treated patients. Although the mechanisms underlying therapy success are not yet clear, induction of endogenous retroelements (EREs) has been hypothesised. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we compared the transcription of EREs in bone marrow HSCs from a new cohort of MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) patients before and after 5-AZA treatment with HSCs from healthy donors and AML patients. We further examined ERE transcription using the most comprehensive annotation of ERE-overlapping transcripts expressed in HSCs, generated here by de novo transcript assembly and supported by full-length RNA-seq. Consistent with prior reports, we found that treatment with 5-AZA increased the representation of ERE-derived RNA-seq reads in the transcriptome. However, such increases were comparable between treatment responses and failures. The extended view of HSC transcriptional diversity offered by de novo transcript assembly argued against 5-AZA-responsive EREs as determinants of the outcome of therapy. Instead, it uncovered pre-treatment expression and alternative splicing of developmentally regulated gene transcripts as predictors of the response of MDS and CMML patients to 5-AZA treatment. Our study identifies the developmentally regulated transcriptional signatures of protein-coding and non-coding genes, rather than EREs, as correlates of a favourable response of MDS and CMML patients to 5-AZA treatment and offers novel candidates for further evaluation.",

Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), 30 myeloid leukemia-associated genes were analyzed in 15 MDS/CMML patients with excellent response to Aza.

Various myeloid cell lines and a healthy cohort were screened for methylation levels in 23 genes. Selected targets were verified on the MDS/CMML cohort. The study presented here showed a stable variant allele frequency and stable global methylation levels in responding patients.

Progression after HMA response was associated with a median overall-survival (OS) of 8 months, while median OS in patients with primary HMA failure was 4 months. Lower serum LDH levels (<250 Units/L) were associated with HMA responses by both criteria; while ASXL1 and TET2 mutational status had no impact. HMA treated patients had a longer median OS (31 vs 18\u2009months; P = .01), in comparison to those treated with conventional care regimens (excluding observation only patients), without any differences between AZA vs DAC (P = .37). In conclusion, this study highlights the inadequacies of HMA therapy in CMML, retrospectively validates the IWG MDS/MPN response criteria and underscores the need for newer, rationally derived therapies.",

    "title": "Droplet digital PCR for the quantification of Alu methylation status in hematological malignancies.",
    "abstract": "Alu repeats, belonging to the Short Interspersed Repetitive Elements (SINEs) class, contain about 25% of CpG sites in the human genome. Alu sequences lie in gene-rich regions, so their methylation is an important transcriptional regulation mechanism. Aberrant Alu methylation has been associated with tumor aggressiveness, and also previously discussed in hematological malignancies, by applying different approaches. Moreover, today different techniques designed to measure global DNA methylation are focused on the methylation level of specific repeat elements. In this work we propose a new method of investigating Alu differential methylation, based on droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) technology. Forty-six patients with hematological neoplasms were included in the study: 30 patients affected by chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 7 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes at intermediate/high risk, according with the International Prognostic Scoring System, and 9 patients with myelomonocytic leukemia. Ten healthy donors were included as controls. Acute promyelocytic leukemia-derived NB4 cell line, either untreated or treated with decitabine (DEC) hypomethylating agent, was also analyzed. DNA samples were investigated for Alu methylation level by digestion of genomic DNA with isoschizomers with differential sensitivity to DNA methylation, followed by ddPCR. Using ddPCR, a significant decrease of the global Alu methylation level in DNA extracted from NB4 cells treated with DEC, as compared to untreated cells, was observed. Moreover, comparing the global Alu methylation levels at diagnosis and after azacytidine (AZA) treatment in MDS patients, a statistically significant decrease of Alu sequences methylation after therapy as compared to diagnosis was evident. We also observed a significant decrease of the Alu methylation level in CLL patients compared to HD, and, finally, for CMML patients, a decrease of Alu sequences methylation was observed in patients harboring the SRSF2 hotspot gene mutation c.284C>D. In our work, we propose a method to investigate Alu differential methylation based on ddPCR technology. This assay introduces ddPCR as a more sensitive and immediate technique for Alu methylation analysis. To date, this is the first application of ddPCR to study DNA repetitive elements. This approach may be useful to profile patients affected by hematologic malignancies for diagnostic/prognostic purpose.",

    "abstract": "Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is an aggressive myeloid neoplasm in which treatment strategies with the capacity to improve survival are currently lacking. Clinical features are heterogeneous and although the overall prognosis is poor, survival can vary significantly between individuals. This reflects the need for an individualized treatment approach which incorporates accurate risk stratification. Though numerous prognostic scores exist, newer CMML-specific models incorporating molecular data should be favored. While asymptomatic, low-risk patients should be observed until their disease progresses, the majority of patients will require treatment. Due to a deficiency in treatments with disease-modifying capacity, any patient who requires treatment should be considered for enrollment in clinical trials evaluating novel therapeutic approaches. Allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) remains the only current therapy with the potential to cure the disease and should be considered in most patients with intermediate- to high-risk disease. However, substantial risks are involved and, in part, because of advanced age at diagnosis, a minority of patients are candidates. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have become a preferred treatment approach, and should be used in those with cytopenias. Patients presenting with proliferative features can be treated with hydroxyurea to manage their symptoms and control leukocytosis, though HMAs can be incorporated as well, particularly in patients with higher risk disease. HMAs should also be considered in patients with a high burden of disease prior to proceeding with allo-SCT. Induction chemotherapy should be reserved for younger, healthy patients who have transformed to acute myeloid leukemia to induce remission prior to transplant. Supportive care utilizing transfusion support, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and infection prevention measures should be incorporated into the care of all patients.",

After a pharmacokinetic assessment period, 31 patients (MDS n = 18, CMML n = 4, and AML n = 9) entered a clinical phase in which they received CC-486\u2009300 mg once-daily for 21 days of repeated 28-day cycles. Median age was 71 years (range: 53-93); 42% of patients were aged \u226575 years. A total of 5 patients with AML (63%) had prior MDS. Median number of CC-486 treatment cycles was 4 (range: 1-32).

    "abstract": "High-dose chemotherapy with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) can produce long-term remission in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR-MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). However, this treatment regimen is not appropriate for elderly and/or comorbid patients; in these cases, azacitidine is a standard treatment. This systematic review was conducted to evaluate real-world evidence of treatment options for patients with HR-MDS/CMML. Medline and Embase (January 2006 to May 2016) were searched, in addition to conference proceedings and treatment guideline reviews. Studies on clinical effectiveness/efficacy outcomes with a sample size\u00a0\u226550 patients were included. From 1061 unique citations identified, 87 full-text articles were reviewed, of which 24 articles reported at least 1 outcome of interest. Studies showed that HR-MDS/CMML patients treated with a conventional chemotherapy regimen (CCR) have poorer overall survival (OS). Key findings from individual HR-MDS studies showed improved survival with azacitidine over CCRs and higher overall response rates with clofarabine relative to low-dose cytosine arabinoside (but no significant difference in 2-year OS favoring clofarabine). OS was highest for patients treated with allo-HSCT. Findings indicate limited real-world data on treatment strategies available for HR-MDS/CMML patients. Most studies address the effect of chemotherapy or allo-HSCT on clinical outcomes, so are not applicable to elderly/comorbid patients who are too frail for those treatments. In particular, our analysis revealed limited evidence on viable options after failure of treatment with azacitidine, identifying a significant unmet need in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia is a\u00a0rare disease and data on the treatment are often extrapolated from myelodysplastic syndrome studies. Although several scores exist for the prognosis of overall survival in chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, so far there is no designated score for the prediction of the time to first treatment. We tested clinical parameters and cytogenetic information for their ability to predict the time to first treatment in our single center cohort of 55 unselected consecutive chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia patients. In multivariate analysis we identified elevated lactate dehydrogenase (\u2265223\u202fU/l), higher bone marrow blast percentage (\u22657.5%) and thrombocytopenia (<55\u202fG/l) at initial diagnosis as the most relevant parameters for the time to first treatment. Using these three parameters we developed a\u00a0risk score that efficiently estimates the time to treatment initiation with azacitidine or hydroxyurea (p\u202f<\u20090.001; log-rank). In the high-risk group (\u22652\u00a0risk factors) 85% of patients required treatment within 1\u00a0year, whereas this was the case in 48% in the intermediate-risk (1\u00a0risk factor) and in 0% in the low-risk group (0\u00a0risk factors).

    "abstract": "Thrombocytopenia in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is usually attributed to impaired marrow production resulting from cytotoxic drug use or CMML itself (\"CMML-induced thrombocytopenia\"). In very rare cases, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) can be a complication of CMML (\"CMML-associated ITP\"). However, treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in patients with CMML is still a challenge. Case 1 was a 61-year-old female patient admitted to our hospital because of skin petechiae and purpura for 6 days. She had increased monocyte cell count (1.82\u200a\u00d7\u200a10/L), markedly decreased platelet count (2\u200a\u00d7\u200a10/L), hypercellularity of the megakaryocyte lineage with many immature megakaryocytes, and ZRSR2(zinc finger CCCH-type, RNA binding motif and serine/arginine rich 2) mutation. She failed to the treatment of corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), TPO (thrombopoietin), and cyclosporin A (CsA). Case 2 was a 72-year-old female patient with thrombocytosis and monocytosis for 4 years, and thrombocytopenia for 6 months. After 10 courses of decitabine therapy, she had a persistent severe thrombocytopenia and decreased number of megakaryocytes, TET2 (tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2) and SRSF2 (serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2) mutations were detected. She was dependent on platelet transfusion. Case 1 was diagnosed as CMML-associated ITP, and case 2 as CMML with decitabine therapy-induced thrombocytopenia. Both patients were treated with eltrombopag. In both patients, the platelet counts returned to the normal within 1 week after eltrombopag therapy. The platelet count in case 1 patient remained stable at 141-200\u200a\u00d7\u200a10/L for 20 months with stopping therapy for 3 months. In case 2 patient, eltrombopag was stopped 1 month later. Her platelet count decreased to 41\u200a\u00d7\u200a10/L, but was stable at \u223c30\u200a\u00d7\u200a10/L for 3 months with platelet transfusion independency for 12 months. Both patients had no adverse effects with eltrombopag. CMML-associated ITP is very rare and easily misdiagnosed. To the best of our knowledge, case 1 is the first reported case of the successful treatment of CMML-associated ITP with eltrombopag. Both CMML-associated ITP and decitabine therapy-induced thrombocytopenia in these 2 patients were highly sensitive and safe to eltrombopag therapy.",

Cutaneous lesions of CMML exhibit heterogeneous histopathologic features that can be challenging to recognize as CMML. We describe a 67-year-old man with a 3-year history of CMML who had been managed on single-agent azacitidine with stable disease before developing splenomegaly and acute onset skin lesions. Examination of these skin lesions revealed a dense infiltrate of histiocytic cells morphologically resembling Langerhans type cells (lacking frank histopathologic atypia), and with the immunophenotype of an indeterminate cell histiocytosis (S100+ CD1a+ and langerin-). Given the history of CMML, next-generation sequencing studies were performed on the skin biopsy. These revealed a KRAS (p.G12R) mutation identical to that seen in the CMML 3\u2009years prior, establishing a clonal relationship between the 2 processes.

Older adults (age\u2009\u2265\u200966 years) who had been diagnosed with CMML from 2001 to 2011 were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, and propensity score matching was used to match patients who had been diagnosed after HMA approval (2007-2011) and had received HMA treatment with patients diagnosed before HMA approval (2001-2003). Cox proportional hazards models with the matched sample were used to assess the change in OS. A second matched cohort of patients who did not receive HMA after approval and patients diagnosed before HMA approval was used to evaluate survival change attributable to other potential differences between the 2 time periods, such as improved supportive care. Among 1378 older adults diagnosed with CMML, the median OS was 13 months, and 18.8% received HMAs. In the primary matched analysis, with 225 HMA users diagnosed in 2007-2011 and 395 patients diagnosed in 2001-2003, the median OS times were 17 and 11 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.91; P\u2009=\u2009.005). In a secondary analysis, the risk of death did not differ between 395 propensity score-matched HMA nonusers diagnosed in 2007-2011 and 484 patients diagnosed in 2001-2003 (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.91-1.32; P\u2009=\u2009.34).

We present the largest retrospective series of CMML (n\u2009=\u2009151) treated with HMA. Mean age at diagnosis was 69 years (range 50-88). According to the CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS): 17 (15%) were low-risk, 45 (39%) intermediate-1 risk, 42 (36%) intermediate-2, and 12 (10%) high-risk. 35 (23%) patients received single agent azacitidine, 73 (48%) single agent decitabine, and 43 (29%) combinations. With a median follow-up of 17 months, overall response rate (ORR) was 75%, with 41% achieving complete response (CR). Median overall survival (OS) was 24 months (95%CI: 20-28) and event-free survival 14 months (95%CI: 11-17). By multivariate analysis, age\u2009<\u200970 years, higher levels of hemoglobin, absence of blast in peripheral blood and lower CPSS cytogenetic risk predicted for better OS. CR was significantly higher in those patients treated with decitabine (58.3%) when compared with azacitidine (20.6%) (P\u2009<\u2009.001). 13 patients (9%) received allo-SCT after a median of 4 cycles of HMA. 66 patients (50%) had HMA failure: 26 primary (34%) and 50 secondary (66%), including 35 (46%) that transformed to AML. Outcomes after HMA failure were poor with OS of 7 months (95%CI: 3-12). In conclusion, HMA are effective in CMML but new agents and combinations are needed. This data could be a benchmark for further drug development in CMML.",

    "abstract": "Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Azacitidine (AZA) is increasingly used prior to HSCT, however in Europe it is only approved for patients who are not eligible for HSCT. We conducted a phase II multicenter study to prospectively evaluate the feasibility of HSCT after treatment with AZA in 70 patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 19 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 8 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). After a median of four cycles (range 1-11): 24% of patients achieved complete remission, 14% partial remission, 8% hematologic improvement, 32% had stable and 22% progressive disease. Ten patients discontinued treatment before the planned four cycles, due to an adverse event in nine cases. A HSC donor was identified in 73 patients, and HSCT was performed in 54 patients (74% of patients with a donor). Main reasons for turning down HSCT were lack of a donor, an adverse event, or progressive disease (9, 12, and 16 patients, respectively). At a median follow-up of 20.5\u2009months from enrolment, response to AZA was the only independent prognostic factor for survival. Compared to baseline assessment, AZA treatment did not affect patients' comorbidities at HSCT: the HCT-CI remained stable in 62% patients, and worsened or improved in 23% and 15% of patients, respectively. Our study shows that HSCT is feasible in the majority of patients with HR-MDS/AML/CMML-2 after AZA treatment. As matched unrelated donor was the most frequent source of donor cells, the time between diagnosis and HSCT needed for donor search could be 'bridged' using azacitidine. These data show that AZA prior to HSCT could be a better option than intensive chemotherapy in higher-risk MDS. The trial has been registered with the EudraCT number 2010-019673-1.",

    "abstract": "Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have been widely used over the last decade, approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The proposed central mechanism of action of HMAs, is the reversal of aberrant methylation in tumor cells, thus reactivating CpG-island promoters and leading to (re)expression of tumor suppressor genes. Recent investigations into the mode of action of azacitidine\u00a0(AZA) and decitabine\u00a0(DAC) have revealed new molecular mechanisms that impinge on tumor immunity via induction of an interferon response, through activation of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) that are normally epigenetically silenced. Although the global demethylation of DNA by HMAs can induce anti-tumor effects, it can also upregulate the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors and their ligands, resulting in secondary resistance to HMAs. Recent studies have, however, suggested that this could be exploited to prime or (re)sensitize tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies. In recent years, immune checkpoints have been targeted by novel therapies, with the aim of (re)activating the host immune system to specifically eliminate malignant cells. Antibodies blocking checkpoint receptors have been FDA-approved for some solid tumors and a plethora of clinical trials testing these and other checkpoint inhibitors are under way. This review will discuss AZA and DAC novel mechanisms of action resulting from the re-expression of pathologically hypermethylated promoters of gene sets that are related to interferon signaling, antigen presentation and inflammation. We also review new insights into the molecular mechanisms of action of transient, low-dose HMAs on various tumor types and discuss the potential of new treatment options and combinations.",

The expression levels of miR-124 in the MNC of 35 MDS patients and 10 healthy donors were detected with stem-loop quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assay. The expression level of miR-124 was lower in MDS patients than that in healthy donors. The difference was not statistically significant between patients with low-risk MDS subtypes (RA and RCMD) and control, but statistically significant between patients with high-risk MDS subtypes (RAEB1, RAEB2 and CMML) and control. This study also proved that expression of miR-124 was reactivated in 7 out of 18 MDS patients after treatment with low dose decitabine.

CMML is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by peripheral blood monocytosis and myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative alterations in the bone marrow. Clinical behavior of the disease can be heterogeneous, with some patients having an indolent form of the disease, whereas others experience an aggressive course with decreased survival and eventual transformation to leukemia. Multiple studies have helped define the clinical, cytogenetic and mutational prognostic features of the disease. In addition, several prognostic scoring systems have been developed for patients with CMML. Incorporation of mutation data, particularly presence of frameshift and nonsense ASXL1 mutations, into these models seems to be allowing to further improve our ability to predict patient outcomes. Prognosis of patients with CMML is heterogeneous. Incorporation of mutational data into current clinical prognostic models has allowed to improve our ability to predict patient outcomes. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only potentially curative treatment for patients with CMML but is only an option for a subset of patients. For this reason, hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine have become the backbone of current therapy for patients with CMML, but new therapeutic strategies are required to improve their outcomes.",

Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities occur in \u223c20-30% of patients, while >90% have gene mutations.
