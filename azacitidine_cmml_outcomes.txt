The current gold standard of response assessment in patients with 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is morphologic complete remission (CR) and CR with 
incomplete count recovery (CRi), both of which require an invasive BM 
evaluation. Outside of clinical trials, BM evaluations are only performed in 
~50% of patients during follow-up, pinpointing a clinical need for response 
endpoints that do not necessitate BM assessments. We define and validate a new 
response type termed "peripheral blood complete remission" (PB-CR) that can be 
determined from the differential blood count and clinical parameters without 
necessitating a BM assessment. We compared the predictive value of PB-CR with 
morphologic CR/CRi in 1441 non-selected, consecutive patients diagnosed with MDS 
(n = 522; 36.2%), CMML (n = 132; 9.2%), or AML (n = 787; 54.6%), included within 
the Austrian Myeloid Registry (aMYELOIDr; NCT04438889). Time-to-event analyses 
were adjusted for 17 covariates remaining in the final Cox proportional hazards 
(CPH) model. DeepSurv, a CPH neural network model, and permutation-based feature 
importance were used to validate results. 1441 patients were included. Adjusted 
median overall survival for patients achieving PB-CR was 22.8 months (95%CI 
18.9-26.2) versus 10.4 months (95%CI 9.7-11.2) for those who did not; HR = 0.366 
(95%CI 0.303-0.441; p < .0001). Among patients achieving CR, those additionally 
achieving PB-CR had a median adjusted OS of 32.6 months (95%CI 26.2-49.2) versus 
21.7 months (95%CI 16.9-27.7; HR = 0.400 [95%CI 0.190-0.844; p = .0161]) for 
those who did not. Our deep neural network analysis-based findings from a large, 
prospective cohort study indicate that BM evaluations solely for the purpose of 
identifying CR/CRi can be omitted.

KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: Hypomethylating agents may be useful in some but not all 
cases of myelodysplastic syndromes. In some versions of these conditions, this 
treatment may yield deleterious results.
ABSTRACT: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is considered to be a 
heterogeneous group of hematopoietic neoplasms. Usually it shares the features 
of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and is 
known as MDS/MPN. It occurs mostly in the elderly and has an inherent tendency 
to transform to acute myeloid leukemia. FDA has approved hypomethylating agents 
(HMAs) such as 5-azacitidine (AZA) and decitabine (DEC) for the treatment of 
this disorder. The extent of response rate to AZA varies considerably among 
patients. Our report describes a patient with CMML who not only did not respond 
to a conventional dose of intravenous (IV) therapy with AZA, but showed marked 
progression of the disease with the leucocyte count rising exponentially while 
undergoing the aforesaid treatment. We believe this is the first such case 
reported in the currently extant literature.

BACKGROUND: Pevonedistat is a first-in-class, small molecular inhibitor of 
NEDD8-activating enzyme that has clinical activity in acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Preclinical data suggest synergy of 
pevonedistat with azacitidine and venetoclax.
METHODS: This single-center, phase 1/2 study evaluated the combination of 
azacitidine, venetoclax and pevonedistat in older adults with newly diagnosed 
secondary AML or with MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) after 
failure of hypomethylating agents. Patients received azacitidine 75 mg/m2 IV on 
days 1-7, venetoclax at maximum dose of 200-400 mg orally on days 1-21 (AML 
cohort) or days 1-14 (MDS/CMML cohort) and pevonedistat 20 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 3 
and 5 for up to 24 cycles. The primary endpoints for the phase 2 portion of the 
study were the CR/CRi rate in the AML cohort and the overall response rate 
(CR + mCR + PR + HI) in the MDS/CMML cohort.
FINDINGS: Forty patients were enrolled (32 with AML and 8 with MDS/CMML). In the 
AML cohort, the median age was 74 years (range 61-86 years), and 27 patients 
(84%) had at least one adverse risk cyto-molecular feature, including 15 (47%) 
with a TP53 mutation or MECOM rearrangement; seventeen patients (53%) had 
received prior therapy for a preceding myeloid disorder. The CR/CRi rate was 66% 
(CR 50%; CRi 16%), and the median overall survival (OS) was 8.1 months. In the 
MDS/CMML cohort, 7 patients (87%) were high or very high risk by the IPSS-R. The 
overall response rate was 75% (CR 13%; mCR with or without HI 50%; HI 13%). The 
most common grade 3-4 adverse events were infection in 16 patients (35%), 
febrile neutropenia in 10 patients (25%) and hypophosphatemia in 9 patients 
(23%). In an exploratory analysis, early upregulation of NOXA expression was 
observed, with subsequent decrease in MCL-1 and FLIP, findings consistent with 
preclinical mechanistic studies of pevonedistat. Upregulation of CD36 was 
observed, which may have contributed to therapeutic resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: The triplet combination of azacitidine, venetoclax and pevonedistat 
shows encouraging activity in this very poor-risk population of patients with 
AML, MDS or CMML. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03862157).

PURPOSE: Venetoclax (VEN) added to the hypomethylating agents (HMA) decitabine 
or azacitidine is the new standard of care for elderly patients with acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) and is being evaluated in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). 
Current dosing of HMA/VEN relies on leukemia suppression through cytotoxicity 
which also impacts normal hematopoiesis. A regimen using once-weekly low-dose 
decitabine (LDDec) has demonstrated activity in myeloid malignancies. To 
overcome the severe myelosuppression often seen with HMA/VEN, we evaluated a 
once-weekly dosing regimen of VEN and LDDec in elderly and/or frail patients who 
were felt less likely to tolerate severe myelosuppression.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-center analysis of 
patients with AML, MDS, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia treated with a 
once-weekly LDDec/VEN regimen. We also compare this regimen with a cohort 
treated with standard dosing HMA/VEN.
RESULTS: In a retrospective cohort of 39 patients, the overall response rate for 
patients receiving LDDec/VEN for first-line AML and MDS was 88% and 64%, 
respectively. In patients with TP53 mutations, the composite complete response 
rate was 71% and the median overall survival was 10.7 months. When compared with 
36 patients receiving standard dose HMA/VEN, the LDDec/VEN patients had a longer 
time on therapy (175 vs. 78 days; P = 0.014) and a trend toward a higher rate of 
transfusion independence (47% vs. 26%; P = 0.33). Neutropenic fever occurred in 
31% of patients, with a median of one hospitalization at any point during 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary clinical experience, although retrospective, 
provides proof-of-activity of noncytotoxic DNA methyltransferase 1-targeting by 
allowing frequent, sustained drug exposure often not possible with standard 
HMA/VEN regimens.
