    "abstract": "Enasidenib is an oral IDH2 inhibitor that reduces the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, differentiating IDH2 mutated leukemic cells with initial promising results for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. We performed a retrospective study in Spain evaluating enasidenib in patients diagnosed with IDH2-mutated myeloid neoplasms (AML, MDS, myeloid sarcoma and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Twenty-three patients were included, with 20 having a refractory/relapsed (R/R) disease status. The median age was 73 years, and the majority patients were classified as adverse risk by the European LeukemiaNet 2022 criteria. The most frequent mutation was IDH2 R140 (69.6%), while 30.4% had R172 mutation. Enasidenib was administered as a single agent in 18 patients, in combination with azacitidine in four patients, and with low-dose cytarabine in another one. The median number of cycles administered was four, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 39.1% and a morphological complete remission (CR) rate of 26.1%. Median overall survival (OS) was 8.3 months. Patients who achieved a complete response had a better outcome than the rest of the patients in terms of OS (19.8 months (95%CI: 15.7-NR) vs. 4.2 (95%CI: 1.5-NR), p\u2009=\u20090.01). Drug-related events included leukocytosis in five patients (21.7%), hyperbilirubinemia in six patients (26.1%) and differentiation syndrome (DS) in four patients (17.4%), including one grade 3 DS and one death related to this latter adverse event (AE), similar to previous findings. Although enasidenib failed to demonstrate a clear overall survival advantage in phase 3 trials, the extended responses and long-term survivors observed herein underscore its therapeutic potential. Ultimately, our data support enasidenib's role as a targeted therapy for IDH2-mutated AML, indicating that expanded access to this agent is warranted to optimize outcomes in these challenging patient populations, especially for R/R AML patients.",

    "abstract": "Atraumatic splenic rupture (ASR) is rare and typically attributed to underlying pathological conditions, with neoplastic diseases being the main etiologies. Traditionally, surgical intervention has been the standard approach for managing ASR in the majority of patients. However, reports on the outcomes of conservative management, especially for ASR related to myeloid neoplasms, are scarce. Here, we present two case reports involving ASR associated with myeloid neoplasms. The first patient, suffering from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) harboring CBL and ASXL1 mutations, developed ASR shortly after receiving treatment with the hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine. The second patient, in the blast phase of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), experienced ASR during the progression of their disease. In the initial case, despite experiencing intense abdominal pain and hypovolemic shock, the patient responded favorably to prompt fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion upon, thanks to a timely diagnosis. A non-operative management approach successfully averted the need for splenectomy or arterial embolism, leading to a favorable outcome. In the second case, the patient presented with progressive abdominal pain but remained hemodynamic stability throughout the ASR episode. We opted for a cautious approach, prioritizing resuscitation, close monitoring, and a watchful waiting strategy. Regrettably, the patient's condition deteriorated, marked by increasing splenomegaly, unchecked leukocytosis, and recurrent parenchymal hemorrhages. Here, we report two cases of ASR in myeloid neoplasms, demonstrating that patients may achieve acceptable outcomes with conservative management.",

The combination of hypomethylating agents with venetoclax (Ven) has demonstrated promising results in these diseases, although randomized clinical trials are needed for validation. In this retrospective study, we compared two matched cohorts of patients with MDS or CMML: one receiving oral decitabine-cedazuridine (DEC-C, n\u2009=\u200973) and one receiving DEC-C and Ven (DEC-C-Ven, n\u2009=\u200951), in three contemporary clinical trials. The aim is to determine the impact of the addition of Ven to HMA in MDS and CMML. Individuals were matched using a propensity score approach that was based on the IPSS-M score and age. All patients had excess blasts; 84% were diagnosed with MDS and 16% with CMML. Most patients had high- or very high-risk disease, according to the revised IPSS-R. The overall response rate was superior in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (90% vs 64%, P\u2009=\u20090.002).

Although epigenetic mechanisms are assumed, responding patients' epigenomes have not been thoroughly examined. We aimed to clarify HbF kinetics and prognostic value for azacytidine treated patients, as well as the epigenetic landscape that might influence HbF re-expression and its clinical relevance. Serial HbF measurements by high-performance liquid chromatography (n\u2009=\u200920) showed induction of HbF only among responders (p\u2009=\u20090.030). Moreover, HbF increase immediately after the first azacytidine cycle demonstrated prognostic value for progression-free survival (PFS) (p\u2009=\u20090.032, HR\u2009=\u20090.19, CI 0.24-1.63).

More recently, the true nature of the myeloid cells present in the cutaneous infiltrates of this theoretically reactive dermatitis is being clarified with the use of new molecular techniques such as next-generation sequencing. The same mutations in bone marrow (BM) myeloid neoplastic cells and in the cells of cutaneous infiltrates have been found. We present the case of a 77-year-old man who presented with spread and treatment-resistant skin granulomatous lesions previous to the diagnosis of CMML. The same clonal mutations in SRSF2, IDH1, and RUNX1 were found in both skin and BM with resolution of the lesions after the initiation of azacytidine. In conclusion, we report an exceptional case in which specific granulomatous cutaneous lesions have preceded and allowed the earlier diagnosis of an underlying CMML and a review of all previous similar cases in the literature, including molecular alterations.",

Our case report explores the rare coexistence of CMML with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in a 63-year-old female patient. CMML diagnosis followed World Health Organization criteria, and the patient was classified as having high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-CMML stage 2. Initial treatment with subcutaneous azacytidine for CMML proved partially effective, highlighting persistent severe thrombocytopenia. Subsequent investigations revealed secondary ITP associated with Crohn's disease. Conventional ITP therapies, including high-dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin, showed limited efficacy. Eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, was initiated, resulting in the normalization of platelet counts within six weeks. Our case emphasizes the diagnostic challenges and intricate treatment landscape of CMML-associated ITP, suggesting eltrombopag as a potential therapeutic option in refractory cases.

The hedgehog (HH) pathway is one of the main pathways for cancer stem cells survival and several HH inhibitors (HHi) are approved in clinical practice. Sonidegib (SON), an oral HHi, was tested in this phase 1/1b trial in combination with azacitidine (AZA, 75 mg/m Sixty-two patients (28 [45%] newly diagnosed) were treated in this study, including 10 patients in the dose-finding component and 52 patients in phase 1b. SON 200 mg oral daily on days 1-28 each cycle was deemed the recommended dose for phase 1b. Out of 21 rrAML patients, two achieved response (one complete response/one morphologic leukemia-free state) with no responses seen in seven r/r MDS/CMML patients. In newly diagnosed AML/MDS, response was seen in six (three had complete remission, two had morphological leukemia-free status) of 27 patients. Median overall survival was 26.4 and 4.7 months for newly diagnosed MDS and AML, respectively. Safety was satisfactory with common (>20%) side effects including fatigue, constipation, nausea, cough, insomnia, and diarrhea. Only 7% of patients died in the study, and none of the deaths were deemed related to treatment. Our study shows that AZA + SON are a safe combination in a patient with MN.

Hence, we aimed to reveal the frequence of infections, predisposing factors of infection and to analyse infection attributable mortality in patients with high-risk MDS, CMML and AML who received hypomethylating agents in our center where routine infection prophylaxis is not applied. 43 adult patients with AML or high-risk MDS or CMML who received HMA \u2265\u00a02 consecutive cycles from January 2014 to December 2020 were enrolled in the study. 43 patients and 173 treatment cycles were analyzed.

The only approved disease-modifying therapies for any of the MDS/MPN are DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) for patients with dysplastic CMML, and still, outcomes are generally poor, making this an important area of unmet clinical need. Due to both the rarity and the heterogeneous nature of MDS/MPN, they have been challenging to study in dedicated prospective studies. Thus, refining first-line treatment strategies has been difficult, and optimal salvage treatments following DNMTi failure have also not been rigorously studied. ABNL-MARRO (A Basket study of Novel therapy for untreated MDS/MPN and Relapsed/Refractory Overlap Syndromes) is an international cooperation that leverages the expertise of the MDS/MPN International Working Group (IWG) and provides the framework for collaborative studies to advance treatment of MDS/MPN and to explore clinical and pathologic markers of disease severity, prognosis, and treatment response. ABNL MARRO 001 (AM-001) is an open label, randomly allocated phase 1/2 study that will test novel treatment combinations in MDS/MPNs, beginning with the novel targeted agent itacitinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor, combined with ASTX727, a fixed dose oral combination of the DNMTi decitabine and the cytidine deaminase inhibitor cedazuridine to improve decitabine bioavailability. Beyond the primary objectives of the study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel treatment combinations in MDS/MPN, the study will (i) Establish the ABNL MARRO infrastructure for future prospective studies, (ii) Forge innovative scientific research that will improve our understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms of disease, and (iii) Inform the clinical application of diagnostic criteria, risk stratification and prognostication tools, as well as response assessments in this heterogeneous patient population.

    "abstract": "This phase 1b study evaluated glasdegib (100 mg once daily)\u2009+\u2009azacitidine in adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Of 72 patients enrolled, 12 were in a lead-in safety cohort (LIC) and 60 were in the AML and MDS (including CMML) expansion cohorts. In the LIC, the safety profile of glasdegib\u2009+\u2009azacitidine was determined to be consistent with those of glasdegib or azacitidine alone, with no evidence of drug-drug interaction. In the expansion cohort, the most frequently (\u2265\u200910%) reported non-hematologic Grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased appetite, electrocardiogram QT prolongation, and hypertension in the AML cohort and sepsis, diarrhea, hypotension, pneumonia, and hyperglycemia in the MDS cohort. Overall response rates in the AML and MDS cohorts were 30.0% and 33.3%, respectively; 47.4% and 46.7% of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline achieved independence. Median overall survival (95% confidence interval) was 9.2 (6.2-14.0) months and 15.8 (9.3-21.9) months, respectively, and response was associated with molecular mutation clearance. Glasdegib\u2009+\u2009azacitidine in patients with newly diagnosed AML or MDS demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and preliminary evidence of clinical benefits.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02367456.",

    "abstract": "In order to improve the outcome observed with azacitidine (AZA) in higher-risk Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), its combination with other drugs in MDS must be evaluated. So far, no combination has not been shown to be more effective than AZA alone. AZA-PLUS was a phase II trial that, in a \"pick a winner\" approach, randomly assigned patients with higher-risk MDS, CMML and low blast count AML to: AZA; AZA plus lenalidomide; AZA plus Valproic Acid or AZA plus Idarubicin. 322 patients were included. After six\u2009cycles, 69 (21.4%) CR\u2009+\u2009PR were observed with no benefit from any combination. Median EFS and OS were 17.2 and 19.7\u2009months in the whole cohort, respectively, with no difference across randomised arms. Infection and rates of hospitalisation during the first six\u2009cycles were higher in the AZA-LEN And AZA-IDA arm, related to increased myelosuppression. Factors associated with better response were IPSS, favourable or intermediate karyotype, haemoglobin, lower circulating blast count, fibrinogen level and lower LDH, while poorer survival was seen in therapy-related MDS and, in the case of TP53, PTPN11 or CSF3R mutation. The combinations used did not improve the outcome obtained with AZA alone. However, our \"pick a winner\" randomised strategy may remain useful with potentially more active drugs to be tested in combination with AZA.",

Data of response rates using the specific response criteria for this disease are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the response to AZA in patients diagnosed with CMML from the Spanish Registry of Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) applying the overlap myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) response criteria. We retrospectively studied 91 patients with CMML treated with at least one cycle of AZA from the Spanish Registry of MDS. As it was a real-world study, the response rate was evaluated between cycle 4 and 6, applying the MDS/MPN response criteria FINDINGS: The overall response rate at cycle 4-6 was 58%. Almost half of the patients achieved transfusion independence and one quarter showed clinical benefit, regardless of the CMML French-American-British (FAB) and World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes and CMML Specific Prognosis Scoring (CPSS) risk groups. Toxicity was higher in the MD-CMML subtype. In our series, most CMML patients achieved an overall response rate with AZA according to the overlap-MDS/MPN response criteria regardless of the CMML FAB and WHO subtypes and CPSS risk groups. Thus, AZA may also be a treatment option for patients with the myeloproliferative CMML subtype and those with a lower-risk CPSS, but symptomatic.",
