## Azacitidine

Azacitidine demonstrates a complete response rate of 14.5% and partial response rate of 23.7%. Median overall survival is 14.9 months with progression-free survival of 7.3 months. Based on 4 studies, the most common serious adverse events include Grade 3-4 Neutropenia (19.2%), Grade 3-4 Thrombocytopenia (12.8%), Febrile Neutropenia (8.4%). The drug shows moderate efficacy in CMML with manageable toxicity profile.
