      "abstract": "Enasidenib is an oral IDH2 inhibitor that reduces the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, differentiating IDH2 mutated leukemic cells with initial promising results for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. We performed a retrospective study in Spain evaluating enasidenib in patients diagnosed with IDH2-mutated myeloid neoplasms (AML, MDS, myeloid sarcoma and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Twenty-three patients were included, with 20 having a refractory/relapsed (R/R) disease status. The median age was 73 years, and the majority patients were classified as adverse risk by the European LeukemiaNet 2022 criteria. The most frequent mutation was IDH2 R140 (69.6%), while 30.4% had R172 mutation. Enasidenib was administered as a single agent in 18 patients, in combination with azacitidine in four patients, and with low-dose cytarabine in another one. The median number of cycles administered was four, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 39.1% and a morphological complete remission (CR) rate of 26.1%. Median overall survival (OS) was 8.3 months. Patients who achieved a complete response had a better outcome than the rest of the patients in terms of OS (19.8 months (95%CI: 15.7-NR) vs. 4.2 (95%CI: 1.5-NR), p\u2009=\u20090.01). Drug-related events included leukocytosis in five patients (21.7%), hyperbilirubinemia in six patients (26.1%) and differentiation syndrome (DS) in four patients (17.4%), including one grade 3 DS and one death related to this latter adverse event (AE), similar to previous findings. Although enasidenib failed to demonstrate a clear overall survival advantage in phase 3 trials, the extended responses and long-term survivors observed herein underscore its therapeutic potential. Ultimately, our data support enasidenib's role as a targeted therapy for IDH2-mutated AML, indicating that expanded access to this agent is warranted to optimize outcomes in these challenging patient populations, especially for R/R AML patients.",

The combination of hypomethylating agents with venetoclax (Ven) has demonstrated promising results in these diseases, although randomized clinical trials are needed for validation. In this retrospective study, we compared two matched cohorts of patients with MDS or CMML: one receiving oral decitabine-cedazuridine (DEC-C, n\u2009=\u200973) and one receiving DEC-C and Ven (DEC-C-Ven, n\u2009=\u200951), in three contemporary clinical trials. The aim is to determine the impact of the addition of Ven to HMA in MDS and CMML. Individuals were matched using a propensity score approach that was based on the IPSS-M score and age. All patients had excess blasts; 84% were diagnosed with MDS and 16% with CMML. Most patients had high- or very high-risk disease, according to the revised IPSS-R. The overall response rate was superior in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (90% vs 64%, P\u2009=\u20090.002). The median times to best response were 1.1 and 2.7 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.001). More patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (47%) than in the DEC-C cohort (16%, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The 4- and 8-week mortality did not significantly differ between the DEC-C and DEC-C-Ven cohorts. Patients in the DEC-C-Ven cohort had a more profound neutropenia at days 15 and 21 of the first cycle. The median overall survival was 24 and 19 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.89), and the median event-free survival durations were 18 and 10 months (P\u2009=\u20090.026).

Introducing concepts like the MDS/AML overlap complicate classifications and including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) in MDS studies introduces another layer of complexity. The International Consortium for MDS emphasizes aligning HR MDS criteria with the 2022 ELN criteria for AML. Differences in advancements between AML and MDS treatments and hematological toxicity in HR MDS underline the importance of detailed trial designs. Effective therapeutic strategies require accurate reporting of adverse events, highlighting the need for clarity in criteria like the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). We provide an overview on negative clinical trials in HR MDS, analyze possible reasons and explore possibilities to optimize future clinical trials in this challenging patient population.",

Overall response rate (ORR) was 37.5% (9 of 24); CR rate, PR rate, and mCR/HI rate were 8.3% (n\u2009=\u20092), 8.3% (n\u2009=\u20092), and 20.8% (n\u2009=\u20095), respectively. At a median duration of follow-up of 14.0\u00a0months (range 0.0-22.0\u00a0months), the median overall survival (OS) was 23.0\u00a0months. Univariate analysis revealed that\u2009\u2265\u20093 cycles of treatment was significantly associated with a higher 1-year OS rate compared with\u2009&lt;\u20093 cycles of AZA treatment. Treatment was generally well-tolerated. The most common (&gt;\u200910%) AEs were thrombocytopenia (n\u2009=\u20097, 29.2%), pneumonitis (n\u2009=\u20094, 16.7%) and fever (n\u2009=\u20093, 12.5%). This study provides valuable real-life data in China on the treatment schedules, efficacy and safety of AZA in the treatment of CMML.",

It is clear that there is still progress to be made. Here, we review the available first-line treatment options for advanced CMML. Emphasis has been placed on choosing between hypomethylating agents and cytotoxic treatments, on the basis on disease-specific and patient-specific characteristics. A proper selection between these two treatments could lead to a better quality of care for patients with CMML.",
