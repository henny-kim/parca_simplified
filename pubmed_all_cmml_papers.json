      "abstract": "Enasidenib is an oral IDH2 inhibitor that reduces the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, differentiating IDH2 mutated leukemic cells with initial promising results for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. We performed a retrospective study in Spain evaluating enasidenib in patients diagnosed with IDH2-mutated myeloid neoplasms (AML, MDS, myeloid sarcoma and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Twenty-three patients were included, with 20 having a refractory/relapsed (R/R) disease status. The median age was 73 years, and the majority patients were classified as adverse risk by the European LeukemiaNet 2022 criteria. The most frequent mutation was IDH2 R140 (69.6%), while 30.4% had R172 mutation. Enasidenib was administered as a single agent in 18 patients, in combination with azacitidine in four patients, and with low-dose cytarabine in another one. The median number of cycles administered was four, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 39.1% and a morphological complete remission (CR) rate of 26.1%. Median overall survival (OS) was 8.3 months. Patients who achieved a complete response had a better outcome than the rest of the patients in terms of OS (19.8 months (95%CI: 15.7-NR) vs. 4.2 (95%CI: 1.5-NR), p\u2009=\u20090.01). Drug-related events included leukocytosis in five patients (21.7%), hyperbilirubinemia in six patients (26.1%) and differentiation syndrome (DS) in four patients (17.4%), including one grade 3 DS and one death related to this latter adverse event (AE), similar to previous findings. Although enasidenib failed to demonstrate a clear overall survival advantage in phase 3 trials, the extended responses and long-term survivors observed herein underscore its therapeutic potential. Ultimately, our data support enasidenib's role as a targeted therapy for IDH2-mutated AML, indicating that expanded access to this agent is warranted to optimize outcomes in these challenging patient populations, especially for R/R AML patients.",

A diagnostic thoracentesis and cytology were conducted, which yielded exudative fluid negative for malignant cells and found reactive mesothelial cells and macrophages in a background of numerous chronic inflammatory cells\u00a0and acellular proteinaceous material. However, due to the limited effectiveness of cytological examination in identifying malignant pleural effusions, the occurrence of leukemic effusions in CMML patients may be underestimated.

      "key_findings": "Pleural effusion is an uncommon occurrence in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients, and its mechanisms remain poorly understood. We report the case of a 66-year-old male with a known medical history of CMML, referred from the oncology clinic due to shortness of breath attributed to a left pleural effusion, evident on a chest X-ray following a chemotherapy session. A diagnostic thoracentesis and cytology were conducted, which yielded exudative fluid negative for malignant cells and found reactive mesothelial cells and macrophages in a background of numerous chronic inflammatory cells\u00a0and acellular proteinaceous material. However, due to the limited effectiveness of cytological examination in identifying malignant pleural effusions, the occurrence of leukemic effusions in CMML patients may be underestimated. This case underscores the importance of prompt recognition and management of pleural effusion in patients with underlying hematologic conditions like CMML.",

Our case report explores the rare coexistence of CMML with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in a 63-year-old female patient. CMML diagnosis followed World Health Organization criteria, and the patient was classified as having high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-CMML stage 2. Initial treatment with subcutaneous azacytidine for CMML proved partially effective, highlighting persistent severe thrombocytopenia. Subsequent investigations revealed secondary ITP associated with Crohn's disease. Conventional ITP therapies, including high-dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin, showed limited efficacy. Eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, was initiated, resulting in the normalization of platelet counts within six weeks. Our case emphasizes the diagnostic challenges and intricate treatment landscape of CMML-associated ITP, suggesting eltrombopag as a potential therapeutic option in refractory cases.

      "abstract": "The current gold standard of response assessment in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is morphologic complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi), both of which require an invasive BM evaluation. Outside of clinical trials, BM evaluations are only performed in ~50% of patients during follow-up, pinpointing a clinical need for response endpoints that do not necessitate BM assessments. We define and validate a new response type termed \"peripheral blood complete remission\" (PB-CR) that can be determined from the differential blood count and clinical parameters without necessitating a BM assessment. We compared the predictive value of PB-CR with morphologic CR/CRi in 1441 non-selected, consecutive patients diagnosed with MDS (n\u2009=\u2009522; 36.2%), CMML (n\u2009=\u2009132; 9.2%), or AML (n\u2009=\u2009787; 54.6%), included within the Austrian Myeloid Registry (aMYELOIDr; NCT04438889). Time-to-event analyses were adjusted for 17 covariates remaining in the final Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model. DeepSurv, a CPH neural network model, and permutation-based feature importance were used to validate results. 1441 patients were included. Adjusted median overall survival for patients achieving PB-CR was 22.8\u2009months (95%CI 18.9-26.2) versus 10.4\u2009months (95%CI 9.7-11.2) for those who did not; HR\u2009=\u20090.366 (95%CI 0.303-0.441; p\u2009<\u2009.0001).

The hedgehog (HH) pathway is one of the main pathways for cancer stem cells survival and several HH inhibitors (HHi) are approved in clinical practice. Sonidegib (SON), an oral HHi, was tested in this phase 1/1b trial in combination with azacitidine (AZA, 75\u00a0mg/m Sixty-two patients (28 [45%] newly diagnosed) were treated in this study, including 10 patients in the dose-finding component and 52 patients in phase 1b. SON 200\u00a0mg oral daily on days 1-28 each cycle was deemed the recommended dose for phase 1b. Out of 21 rrAML patients, two achieved response (one complete response/one morphologic leukemia-free state) with no responses seen in seven r/r MDS/CMML patients. In newly diagnosed AML/MDS, response was seen in six (three had complete remission, two had morphological leukemia-free status) of 27 patients. Median overall survival was 26.4 and 4.7\u00a0months for newly diagnosed MDS and AML, respectively. Safety was satisfactory with common (>20%) side effects including fatigue, constipation, nausea, cough, insomnia, and diarrhea. Only 7% of patients died in the study, and none of the deaths were deemed related to treatment. Our study shows that AZA\u00a0+\u00a0SON are a safe combination in a patient with MN.

In a\u00a0retrospective observational study, we analyzed 168 CMML patients regarding treatment options and survival during the past three decades. The proportion of patients treated with hydroxyurea (HU), intensive chemotherapy, and azacitidine (AZA) was 65/19/0% before 2000, 51/25/32% from 2000-2010, and 36/12/53% after 2010, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) increased from 10\u00a0months before 2000 to 23\u00a0months thereafter (p\u202f=\u20090.021). AZA-treated patients but not patients treated with other treatment options had improved survival as compared to CMML patients without AZA therapy (19\u00a0vs. 25\u00a0months, p\u202f=\u20090.041). When looking at subgroups, the following patient cohorts had a\u00a0significant survival benefit in association with AZA therapy: patients with Hb\u202f>\u200910\u202fg/dL, patients with monocytosis\u202f>\u200910\u202fG/L, and patients with mutations in RASopathy genes.",

ABNL-MARRO (A Basket study of Novel therapy for untreated MDS/MPN and Relapsed/Refractory Overlap Syndromes) is an international cooperation that leverages the expertise of the MDS/MPN International Working Group (IWG) and provides the framework for collaborative studies to advance treatment of MDS/MPN and to explore clinical and pathologic markers of disease severity, prognosis, and treatment response. ABNL MARRO 001 (AM-001) is an open label, randomly allocated phase 1/2 study that will test novel treatment combinations in MDS/MPNs, beginning with the novel targeted agent itacitinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor, combined with ASTX727, a fixed dose oral combination of the DNMTi decitabine and the cytidine deaminase inhibitor cedazuridine to improve decitabine bioavailability. Beyond the primary objectives of the study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel treatment combinations in MDS/MPN, the study will (i) Establish the ABNL MARRO infrastructure for future prospective studies, (ii) Forge innovative scientific research that will improve our understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms of disease, and (iii) Inform the clinical application of diagnostic criteria, risk stratification and prognostication tools, as well as response assessments in this heterogeneous patient population.

      "abstract": "Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a rare clonal haematological malignancy bearing characteristics of both myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms. It primarily affects older people (median age at diagnosis ~72 years). There are many challenges encountered in its treatment. One striking issue is the lack of strong clinical evidence from large randomized clinical trials for treating this disease. Another issue is that patients with CMML have highly variable outcomes with current treatments. Additional challenges include a wider application of current knowledge, an improved understanding of pathogenesis, development of new therapies, and management of refractory cases/disease progression. It is clear that there is still progress to be made. Here, we review the available first-line treatment options for advanced CMML. Emphasis has been placed on choosing between hypomethylating agents and cytotoxic treatments, on the basis on disease-specific and patient-specific characteristics. A proper selection between these two treatments could lead to a better quality of care for patients with CMML.",

      "key_findings": "Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a rare clonal haematological malignancy bearing characteristics of both myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms. It primarily affects older people (median age at diagnosis ~72 years). There are many challenges encountered in its treatment. One striking issue is the lack of strong clinical evidence from large randomized clinical trials for treating this disease. Another issue is that patients with CMML have highly variable outcomes with current treatments. Additional challenges include a wider application of current knowledge, an improved understanding of pathogenesis, development of new therapies, and management of refractory cases/disease progression. It is clear that there is still progress to be made. Here, we review the available first-line treatment options for advanced CMML. Emphasis has been placed on choosing between hypomethylating agents and cytotoxic treatments, on the basis on disease-specific and patient-specific characteristics. A proper selection between these two treatments could lead to a better quality of care for patients with CMML.",

The development of oral HMAs has been an area of active interest; however, oral bioavailability has been quite poor due to rapid metabolism by cytidine deaminase (CDA). This led to the development of the novel CDA inhibitor cedazuridine, which was combined with an oral formulation of decitabine.

The development of oral HMAs has been an area of active interest; however, oral bioavailability has been quite poor due to rapid metabolism by cytidine deaminase (CDA). This led to the development of the novel CDA inhibitor cedazuridine, which was combined with an oral formulation of decitabine.

      "abstract": "The investigational NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor pevonedistat is being evaluated in combination with azacitidine versus single-agent azacitidine in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (higher-risk MDS), higher-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (higher-risk CMML), or low-blast acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a Phase 3 trial PANTHER. To support Asia-inclusive global development, we applied multiregional clinical trial (MRCT) principles of the International Conference on Harmonisation E17 guidelines by evaluating similarity in drug-related and disease-related intrinsic and extrinsic factors. A PubMed literature review (January 2000-November 2019) supported similarity in epidemiology of higher-risk MDS, AML, and CMML in Western and East Asian populations. Furthermore, the treatment of MDS/AML was similar in both East Asian and Western regions, with the same dose of azacitidine being the standard of care. Median overall survival in MDS following azacitidine treatment was generally comparable across regions, and the types and frequencies of molecular alterations in AML and MDS were comparable. Dose-escalation studies established the same maximum tolerated dose of pevonedistat in combination with azacitidine in Western and East Asian populations. Pevonedistat clearance was similar across races. Taken together, conservation of drug-related and disease-related intrinsic and extrinsic factors supported design of an Asia-inclusive Phase 3 trial and a pooled East Asian region. A sample size of ~\u00a030 East Asian patients (of ~\u00a0450 randomized) was estimated as needed to demonstrate consistency in efficacy relative to the global population. This analysis is presented as an exemplar to illustrate application of clinical pharmacology and translational science principles in designing Asia-inclusive MRCTs. Study Highlights WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? Azacitidine is the standard of care for myelodysplastic syndromes/low-blast acute myeloid leukemia (AML) across Western and East Asian patients. The first-in-class small-molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme, pevonedistat, has been investigated as a single agent in multiple studies of hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies and in combination with azacitidine in elderly patients with untreated AML. WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS? By applying clinical pharmacology and translational science and International Conference on Harmonisation E17 principles, this study designed an East Asian-inclusive global pivotal Phase 3 trial of pevonedistat, taking into consideration drug-related and disease-related intrinsic and extrinsic factors. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE? These analyses provide scientific rationale for Asia-inclusive globalization of the pivotal, Phase 3 PANTHER trial and for pooling clinical data across the East Asian region for assessing consistency in efficacy.

The presence of pleural effusion is usually associated with uncontrolled leukocytosis and increased monocytes. Here we reported a rare case of CMML-0 with pleural effusion as the first manifestation in a 44-year-old woman. The pleural effusion was caused by blasts infiltration confirmed by the flow cytometer and the pleural biopsy. CMML with pleural invasion. The patient was treated with azacitidine 75\u200amg/m\u200ad for 2 cycles, followed by daily oral intake of hydroxyurea (500\u200amg/d). Pleural effusion was resolved and chest pain was relieved. The current case indicated that leukemic infiltration into pleura could occur despite mild leukocytes, while demethylation may be an effective therapy.",

Using lentiviral expression of MN1 for oncogenic supplementation and transplanting transduced primary mononuclear CMML cells into immunocompromised mice, we established three serially transplantable CMML-PDX models with disease-related gene mutations that recapitulate the disease in vivo.

DNA samples were investigated for Alu methylation level by digestion of genomic DNA with isoschizomers with differential sensitivity to DNA methylation, followed by ddPCR. Using ddPCR, a significant decrease of the global Alu methylation level in DNA extracted from NB4 cells treated with DEC, as compared to untreated cells, was observed. Moreover, comparing the global Alu methylation levels at diagnosis and after azacytidine (AZA) treatment in MDS patients, a statistically significant decrease of Alu sequences methylation after therapy as compared to diagnosis was evident. We also observed a significant decrease of the Alu methylation level in CLL patients compared to HD, and, finally, for CMML patients, a decrease of Alu sequences methylation was observed in patients harboring the SRSF2 hotspot gene mutation c.284C>D.

This study of extended CC-486 dosing included patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). After a pharmacokinetic assessment period, 31 patients (MDS n = 18, CMML n = 4, and AML n = 9) entered a clinical phase in which they received CC-486\u2009300 mg once-daily for 21 days of repeated 28-day cycles. Median age was 71 years (range: 53-93); 42% of patients were aged \u226575 years. A total of 5 patients with AML (63%) had prior MDS. Median number of CC-486 treatment cycles was 4 (range: 1-32). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were gastrointestinal (84% of patients) and hematologic (81%). Most common grade 3-4 TEAEs were neutropenia (n = 13, 42%) and anemia (n = 9, 29%). Ten patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia.

Neutropenia in early treatment cycles deserves scrutiny and may warrant initiation of prophylactic antibiotics. KEY POINTS: The safety profile of oral CC-486 was comparable to that of injectable azacitidine; most adverse events were hematological and gastrointestinal.

She had increased monocyte cell count (1.82\u200a\u00d7\u200a10/L), markedly decreased platelet count (2\u200a\u00d7\u200a10/L), hypercellularity of the megakaryocyte lineage with many immature megakaryocytes, and ZRSR2(zinc finger CCCH-type, RNA binding motif and serine/arginine rich 2) mutation. She failed to the treatment of corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), TPO (thrombopoietin), and cyclosporin A (CsA). Case 2 was a 72-year-old female patient with thrombocytosis and monocytosis for 4 years, and thrombocytopenia for 6 months.

Older adults (age\u2009\u2265\u200966 years) who had been diagnosed with CMML from 2001 to 2011 were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, and propensity score matching was used to match patients who had been diagnosed after HMA approval (2007-2011) and had received HMA treatment with patients diagnosed before HMA approval (2001-2003). Cox proportional hazards models with the matched sample were used to assess the change in OS. A second matched cohort of patients who did not receive HMA after approval and patients diagnosed before HMA approval was used to evaluate survival change attributable to other potential differences between the 2 time periods, such as improved supportive care. Among 1378 older adults diagnosed with CMML, the median OS was 13 months, and 18.8% received HMAs. In the primary matched analysis, with 225 HMA users diagnosed in 2007-2011 and 395 patients diagnosed in 2001-2003, the median OS times were 17 and 11 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.91; P\u2009=\u2009.005). In a secondary analysis, the risk of death did not differ between 395 propensity score-matched HMA nonusers diagnosed in 2007-2011 and 484 patients diagnosed in 2001-2003 (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.91-1.32; P\u2009=\u2009.34).

      "abstract": "Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Azacitidine (AZA) is increasingly used prior to HSCT, however in Europe it is only approved for patients who are not eligible for HSCT. We conducted a phase II multicenter study to prospectively evaluate the feasibility of HSCT after treatment with AZA in 70 patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 19 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 8 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). After a median of four cycles (range 1-11): 24% of patients achieved complete remission, 14% partial remission, 8% hematologic improvement, 32% had stable and 22% progressive disease. Ten patients discontinued treatment before the planned four cycles, due to an adverse event in nine cases. A HSC donor was identified in 73 patients, and HSCT was performed in 54 patients (74% of patients with a donor). Main reasons for turning down HSCT were lack of a donor, an adverse event, or progressive disease (9, 12, and 16 patients, respectively). At a median follow-up of 20.5\u2009months from enrolment, response to AZA was the only independent prognostic factor for survival. Compared to baseline assessment, AZA treatment did not affect patients' comorbidities at HSCT: the HCT-CI remained stable in 62% patients, and worsened or improved in 23% and 15% of patients, respectively. Our study shows that HSCT is feasible in the majority of patients with HR-MDS/AML/CMML-2 after AZA treatment. As matched unrelated donor was the most frequent source of donor cells, the time between diagnosis and HSCT needed for donor search could be 'bridged' using azacitidine. These data show that AZA prior to HSCT could be a better option than intensive chemotherapy in higher-risk MDS. The trial has been registered with the EudraCT number 2010-019673-1.",

Recent investigations into the mode of action of azacitidine\u00a0(AZA) and decitabine\u00a0(DAC) have revealed new molecular mechanisms that impinge on tumor immunity via induction of an interferon response, through activation of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) that are normally epigenetically silenced.

In recent years, immune checkpoints have been targeted by novel therapies, with the aim of (re)activating the host immune system to specifically eliminate malignant cells. Antibodies blocking checkpoint receptors have been FDA-approved for some solid tumors and a plethora of clinical trials testing these and other checkpoint inhibitors are under way. This review will discuss AZA and DAC novel mechanisms of action resulting from the re-expression of pathologically hypermethylated promoters of gene sets that are related to interferon signaling, antigen presentation and inflammation.

Treatment with 5-azacytidine led to the complete remission of both diseases. Thus, targeting DNA methylation abnormalities in AITL may be an alternative strategy to chemotherapy.

In this study, 123 patients with MDS and SIADs were analysed. Mean age was 70 years (s.d. 13) and the male:female ratio was 2. The SIADs were systemic vasculitis in 39 (32%) cases, CTD in 31 (25%) cases, inflammatory arthritis in 28 (23%) cases, a neutrophilic disorder in 12 (10%) cases and unclassified in 13 cases (11%). The SIADs fulfilled the usual classification criteria in 75 (66%) cases, while complete criteria were not reached in 21 (19%) cases. A significant association was shown between chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) and systemic vasculitis (P = 0.0024). One hundred and eighteen (96%) SIAD patients were treated (91% with steroids), with an 83% response to first-line treatment, including 80% for steroids alone. A second-line treatment for SIADs was required for steroid dependence or relapse in 48% of cases. The effect of MDS treatment on SIADs could be assessed in 11 patients treated with azacytidine and SIAD response was achieved in 9/11 (80%) and 6/11 (55%) patients at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Compared with 665 MDS/CMML patients without SIADs, MDS/CMML patients with SIADs were younger (P < 0.01), male (P = 0.03), less often had refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (P < 0.01), more often had a poor karyotype (16% vs 11%, P = 0.04) and less frequently belonged to low and intermediate-1 International Prognostic Scoring System categories, but no survival difference was seen between patients with MDS-associated SIADs and without SIADs (P = 0.5). The spectrum of SIADs associated to MDS is heterogeneous, steroid sensitive, but often steroid dependent.",

      "key_findings": "We describe myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-associated systemic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (SIADs), their treatments and outcomes and the impact of SIADs on overall survival in a French multicentre retrospective study. In this study, 123 patients with MDS and SIADs were analysed. Mean age was 70 years (s.d. 13) and the male:female ratio was 2. The SIADs were systemic vasculitis in 39 (32%) cases, CTD in 31 (25%) cases, inflammatory arthritis in 28 (23%) cases, a neutrophilic disorder in 12 (10%) cases and unclassified in 13 cases (11%). The SIADs fulfilled the usual classification criteria in 75 (66%) cases, while complete criteria were not reached in 21 (19%) cases. A significant association was shown between chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) and systemic vasculitis (P = 0.0024). One hundred and eighteen (96%) SIAD patients were treated (91% with steroids), with an 83% response to first-line treatment, including 80% for steroids alone. A second-line treatment for SIADs was required for steroid dependence or relapse in 48% of cases. The effect of MDS treatment on SIADs could be assessed in 11 patients treated with azacytidine and SIAD response was achieved in 9/11 (80%) and 6/11 (55%) patients at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Compared with 665 MDS/CMML patients without SIADs, MDS/CMML patients with SIADs were younger (P < 0.01), male (P = 0.03), less often had refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (P < 0.01), more often had a poor karyotype (16% vs 11%, P = 0.04) and less frequently belonged to low and intermediate-1 International Prognostic Scoring System categories, but no survival difference was seen between patients with MDS-associated SIADs and without SIADs (P = 0.5). The spectrum of SIADs associated to MDS is heterogeneous, steroid sensitive, but often steroid dependent.",

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including treatment-related TEAEs, and serious TEAEs (TESAEs) were recorded throughout the study. Treatment response [complete response (CR), partial response (PR), haematological improvement (HI), stable disease (SD), treatment failure (TF)) and transfusion-independence (TI) were evaluated at completion of a 1-year observation period (1YOP) or at treatment discontinuation, and overall survival (OS), at study conclusion. The median age of patients was 74\u00b77 (range: 43\u00b79-87\u00b78) years; 69\u00b74% had MDS, 26\u00b75% had primary or secondary AML, and 4\u00b71% had CMML. Treatment-related TEAEs, grade 3-4 TEAEs, and TESAEs were reported in 67\u00b73%, 28\u00b76%, and 18\u00b74% of patients, respectively. During 1YOP, patients received a median of 7 (1-12) treatment cycles. Treatment response was assessed for 38/49 patients. Among MDS and CMML patients (n\u200a=\u200a29), 41\u00b74% had CR, PR, or HI, 41\u00b74% had SD, and 17\u00b72% had TF.

Treatment response, dose, and schedule were assessed. This non-interventional, post-marketing survey included 49/50 patients receiving azacitidine at 14 Belgian haematology centres from 2010-2012. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including treatment-related TEAEs, and serious TEAEs (TESAEs) were recorded throughout the study. Treatment response [complete response (CR), partial response (PR), haematological improvement (HI), stable disease (SD), treatment failure (TF)) and transfusion-independence (TI) were evaluated at completion of a 1-year observation period (1YOP) or at treatment discontinuation, and overall survival (OS), at study conclusion. The median age of patients was 74\u00b77 (range: 43\u00b79-87\u00b78) years; 69\u00b74% had MDS, 26\u00b75% had primary or secondary AML, and 4\u00b71% had CMML. Treatment-related TEAEs, grade 3-4 TEAEs, and TESAEs were reported in 67\u00b73%, 28\u00b76%, and 18\u00b74% of patients, respectively. During 1YOP, patients received a median of 7 (1-12) treatment cycles. Treatment response was assessed for 38/49 patients. Among MDS and CMML patients (n\u200a=\u200a29), 41\u00b74% had CR, PR, or HI, 41\u00b74% had SD, and 17\u00b72% had TF. Among AML patients (n\u200a=\u200a9), 44\u00b74% had CR or PR, 33\u00b73% had SD, and 22\u00b72% had TF. TI was observed in 14/32 (43\u00b78%) patients who were transfusion-dependent at baseline. Median (95% confidence interval) OS was 490 (326-555) days; 1-year OS estimate was 0\u00b7571 (0\u00b7422-0\u00b7696). Our data support previous findings that azacitidine has a clinically acceptable safety profile and shows efficacy.",

We studied the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), PD-L2, programmed death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) mRNA in CD34+ cells from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (N=124). Aberrant upregulation (\u2a7e2-fold) was observed in 34, 14, 15 and 8% of the patients. Increased expression of these four genes was also observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) (N=61). The relative expression of PD-L1 from PBMNC was significantly higher in MDS (P=0.018) and CMML (P=0.0128) compared with AML. By immunohistochemical analysis, PD-L1 protein expression was observed in MDS CD34+ cells, whereas stroma/non-blast cellular compartment was positive for PD-1. In a cohort of patients treated with epigenetic therapy, PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1 and CTLA4 expression was upregulated. Patients resistant to therapy had relative higher increments in gene expression compared with patients who achieved response. Treatment of leukemia cells with decitabine resulted in a dose-dependent upregulation of above genes. Exposure to decitabine resulted in partial demethylation of PD-1 in leukemia cell lines and human samples. This study suggests that PD-1 signaling may be involved in MDS pathogenesis and resistance mechanisms to hypomethylating agents. Blockade of this pathway can be a potential therapy in MDS and AML.",

We studied the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), PD-L2, programmed death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) mRNA in CD34+ cells from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (N=124). Aberrant upregulation (\u2a7e2-fold) was observed in 34, 14, 15 and 8% of the patients. Increased expression of these four genes was also observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) (N=61). The relative expression of PD-L1 from PBMNC was significantly higher in MDS (P=0.018) and CMML (P=0.0128) compared with AML. By immunohistochemical analysis, PD-L1 protein expression was observed in MDS CD34+ cells, whereas stroma/non-blast cellular compartment was positive for PD-1. In a cohort of patients treated with epigenetic therapy, PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1 and CTLA4 expression was upregulated. Patients resistant to therapy had relative higher increments in gene expression compared with patients who achieved response. Treatment of leukemia cells with decitabine resulted in a dose-dependent upregulation of above genes. Exposure to decitabine resulted in partial demethylation of PD-1 in leukemia cell lines and human samples. This study suggests that PD-1 signaling may be involved in MDS pathogenesis and resistance mechanisms to hypomethylating agents. Blockade of this pathway can be a potential therapy in MDS and AML.",

      "abstract": "Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder that is classified as a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm by the 2008 World Health Organization classification of hematopoietic tumors. It is characterized by absolute monocytosis (>1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2079/L) in the peripheral blood that persists for at least 3 months. The diagnosis of CMML rests on a combination of morphologic, histopathologic and chromosomal abnormalities in the bone marrow. It is important to exclude other myeloproliferative neoplasms and infectious/autoimmune conditions that can cause monocytosis. Several CMML-specific prognostic models incorporating novel mutations have been recently reported. The Mayo prognostic model classified CMML patients into three risk groups based on: increased absolute monocyte count, presence of circulating blasts, hemoglobin <10 gm/dL and platelets <100\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2079/L. The median survival was 32 months, 18.5 months and 10 months in the low, intermediate, and high-risk groups, respectively. The Groupe Francophone des (GFM) score segregated CMML patients into three risk groups based on: age >65 years, WBC >15\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2079/L, anemia, platelets <100\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2079/L, and ASXL1 mutation status. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, survival ranged from not reached in the low-risk group to 14.4 months in the high-risk group. The Food and Drug Administration has approved azacitidine and decitabine for the treatment of patients with CMML. An allogeneic stem cell transplant can potentially offer a curative option to a subset of CMML patients. It is hoped that with the discovery of several novel mutations, targeted therapies will become available in the near future.",

      "abstract": "The efficacy of azacitidine in the treatment of high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (20-30% blasts) has been demonstrated. To investigate the efficacy of azacitidine in daily clinical practice and to identify predictors for response, we analysed a cohort of 90 MDS, CMML and AML patients who have been treated in a Dutch compassionate named patient programme. Patients received azacitidine for a median of five cycles (range 1-19). The overall response rate (complete/partial/haematological improvement) was 57% in low risk MDS, 53% in high risk MDS, 50% in CMML, and 39% in AML patients. Median overall survival (OS) was 13\u00b70 (9\u00b78-16\u00b72) months. Multivariate analysis confirmed circulating blasts [Hazard Ratio (HR) 0\u00b748, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0\u00b724-0\u00b799; P\u2003=\u20030\u00b705] and poor risk cytogenetics (HR 0\u00b745, 95% CI 0\u00b722-0\u00b791; P\u2003=\u20030\u00b703) as independent predictors for OS. Interestingly, this analysis also identified platelet doubling after the first cycle of azacitidine as a simple and independent positive predictor for OS (HR 5\u00b74, 95% CI 0\u00b773-39\u00b79; P\u2003=\u20030\u00b710). In conclusion, routine administration of azacitidine to patients with variable risk groups of MDS, CMML and AML is feasible, and subgroups with distinct efficacy of azacitidine treatment can be identified.",

      "key_findings": "The efficacy of azacitidine in the treatment of high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (20-30% blasts) has been demonstrated. To investigate the efficacy of azacitidine in daily clinical practice and to identify predictors for response, we analysed a cohort of 90 MDS, CMML and AML patients who have been treated in a Dutch compassionate named patient programme. Patients received azacitidine for a median of five cycles (range 1-19). The overall response rate (complete/partial/haematological improvement) was 57% in low risk MDS, 53% in high risk MDS, 50% in CMML, and 39% in AML patients. Median overall survival (OS) was 13\u00b70 (9\u00b78-16\u00b72) months. Multivariate analysis confirmed circulating blasts [Hazard Ratio (HR) 0\u00b748, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0\u00b724-0\u00b799; P\u2003=\u20030\u00b705] and poor risk cytogenetics (HR 0\u00b745, 95% CI 0\u00b722-0\u00b791; P\u2003=\u20030\u00b703) as independent predictors for OS. Interestingly, this analysis also identified platelet doubling after the first cycle of azacitidine as a simple and independent positive predictor for OS (HR 5\u00b74, 95% CI 0\u00b773-39\u00b79; P\u2003=\u20030\u00b710). In conclusion, routine administration of azacitidine to patients with variable risk groups of MDS, CMML and AML is feasible, and subgroups with distinct efficacy of azacitidine treatment can be identified.",

The patient outcomes governing relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were defined as overall survival, time to progression (TTP) to AML, adverse events and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The clinical evidence was derived from an open-label randomised controlled trial referred to as study AZA-001. It compared aza with CCR in 358 patients with higher risk MDS, CMML and AML 20-30% blasts. The outcomes reported in AZA-001 included overall survival, TTP to AML and adverse events. No HRQoL results were reported; however, outcomes likely to impact on HRQoL were provided. The results showed that: the median overall survival was 24.5 months on aza, compared with 15.0 months in the CCR group (p = 0.0001); the response rates were low (complete remission 17% aza versus 8% CCR); the median time to transformation to AML was greater in the aza group (17.8 versus 11.5 months; p < 0.0001); and of patients who were red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent at baseline, 45% of those on aza became RBC transfusion-independent during the treatment period, compared with 11.8% in the CCR group (p < 0.0001). The ERG reran the submission's search strategies after some modifications incorporating minor improvements. The ERG analysed the submitted economic model (model 1) and identified a number of inconsistencies and errors within the model. The manufacturer submitted a revised model for analysis by the ERG. Using the issues identified in the earlier analysis, the ERG conducted those repairs to the revised model that were feasible within time constraints. The ERG ran this version in probabilistic sensitivity analyses to generate cost-effectiveness acceptability frontiers. The results of these exploratory analyses indicated that: for standard-dose chemotherapy (SDC)-treated patients, of six treatment options available, best supportive care (BSC) was likely the most cost-effective option up to a threshold of 51,000 pounds/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) [beyond 51,000 pounds/QALY, aza + low-dose chemotherapy (LDC) became cost-effective]; for LDC-treated patients, of four options available, BSC was again the most cost-effective option up to a willingness-to-pay threshold of 51,000 pounds/QALY (aza + LDC became cost-effective after 51,000 pounds/QALY); for BSC-treated patients, aza + BSC became cost-effective relative to BSC at a threshold of about 52,000 pounds/QALY. The ERG considers these results exploratory and considers that they should be viewed with caution. The AZA-001 study showed that, compared with CCR, those MDS patients receiving aza had prolonged median survival, had delayed progression to AML, had reduced dependence on transfusions and had a small improvement in response rate. Given the general paucity of economic modelling work in MDS and the limitations of the submitted industry model there is an evident need for an independent cost-effectiveness analysis of aza in MDS. At the time of writing, the guidance appraisal consultation document issued by NICE on 4 March 2010 states that azacitidine is not recommended as a treatment option for people not eligible for haemopoietic stem cell transplantation with the the following conditions: intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, CMML with 10-29% marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder, or with AML with 20-30% blasts and multilineage dysplasia, according to World Health Organization classification.",

We conducted a phase II multicenter study on the combination of the DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) in patients with higher risk MDS. We enrolled 62 patients with MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts, 39 patients; refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation, 19 patients; and chronic myelomanocytic leukemia (CMML), 4 patients) and an International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) rating of Intermediate-2 (42 patients) or high (20 patients). VPA was given to reach a plasma concentration of >50 microg/mL, then 5-AZA was added s.c. at 75 mg/m(2) for 7 days in eight monthly cycles. The median overall survival was 14.4 months. At a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 0.7-21.0), the disease progressed in 20 patients, with 21% cumulative incidence of progression. Of 26 patients who completed eight cycles, 30.7% obtained complete or partial remission, 15.4% had a major hematologic improvement, whereas 38.5% showed stable disease. Drug-related toxicity was mild. Favorable prognostic factors for survival were IPSS Intermediate-2 and plasma VPA of > or =50 microg/mL (log rank = 0.013 and 0.007, respectively). Analysis of polymorphisms important for the metabolism of the drugs used in the trial showed that carriers of the CYP2C19*2 variant of cytochrome P450 required higher VPA doses to achieve the target VPA plasma concentration of 50 microg/mL on day 1 of 5-AZA treatment (P = 0.0021). Our data show that the 5-AZA/VPA combination is active and safe in patients with MDS with a poor prognosis. Achievement of VPA therapeutic levels may indeed increase 5-AZA efficacy.",

We enrolled 62 patients with MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts, 39 patients; refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation, 19 patients; and chronic myelomanocytic leukemia (CMML), 4 patients) and an International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) rating of Intermediate-2 (42 patients) or high (20 patients). VPA was given to reach a plasma concentration of >50 microg/mL, then 5-AZA was added s.c. at 75 mg/m(2) for 7 days in eight monthly cycles. The median overall survival was 14.4 months. At a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 0.7-21.0), the disease progressed in 20 patients, with 21% cumulative incidence of progression. Of 26 patients who completed eight cycles, 30.7% obtained complete or partial remission, 15.4% had a major hematologic improvement, whereas 38.5% showed stable disease. Drug-related toxicity was mild. Favorable prognostic factors for survival were IPSS Intermediate-2 and plasma VPA of > or =50 microg/mL (log rank = 0.013 and 0.007, respectively). Analysis of polymorphisms important for the metabolism of the drugs used in the trial showed that carriers of the CYP2C19*2 variant of cytochrome P450 required higher VPA doses to achieve the target VPA plasma concentration of 50 microg/mL on day 1 of 5-AZA treatment (P = 0.0021). Our data show that the 5-AZA/VPA combination is active and safe in patients with MDS with a poor prognosis. Achievement of VPA therapeutic levels may indeed increase 5-AZA efficacy.",

Sixty patients with a diagnosis of MDS (n = 30) or CMML (n = 30) were treated. Their median age was 66 years, with 50 patients (83%) being over 60 years of age at time of study entry. Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 50% of patients and thrombocytopenia of less than 50 x 10(9)/L in 50%. Topotecan was administered as 2 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for five days (10 mg/m2 per course) every 4 to 6 weeks for two courses, then at maximum tolerated dose level (1-2 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for five days) once every 4-8 weeks for a maximum of 12 courses. Evaluation of outcome and of differences among subgroups was performed according to standard methods; the criteria for response were those used for acute leukemia. Nineteen patients (31%) achieved a complete response (CR). A CR was achieved in 11 of 30 patients with MDS (37%) and in eight of 30 with CMML (27%). A CR was achieved in 10 of 23 patients with previously untreated MDS (43%). Eight of 11 patients who presented with cytogenetic abnormalities (five of which involved chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities) and achieved CR, were evaluated cytogenetically in CR: all were cytogenetically normal in CR. Characteristics associated with a higher CR rate were lack of previous chemotherapy, absence of ras oncogene mutations, and presence of less than 10% monocytes in either peripheral blood or bone marrow. In contrast, CR rates were similar by different agent groups, by different karyotype abnormalities, and by other pre-therapy peripheral blood counts. Non-myelosuppressive side effects were mucositis in 67% of patients (severe [grade 3-4] 23%), diarrhea in 38% (severe 17%), and nausea and vomiting in 28% (severe 5%). Febrile episodes during neutropenia occurred in 85% of patients and documented infections in 47 %. Mortality in the first four weeks was 20%. With a median follow-up duration of 31 months, the 12 month survival rate was 38%, median survival time 10.5 months, and median remission duration 7.5 months. In summary, topotecan has significant single-agent activity in MDS and CMML. Complete responses associated with topotecan therapy often involve the disappearance of abnormal, poor-prognosis karyotypes, which is particularly encouraging. Future strategies to optimize topotecan's role include combination regimens with topoisomerase II reactive agents, cytarabine, or hypomethylating agents (azacytidine and decitabine).",

In this retrospective study, we compared two matched cohorts of patients with MDS or CMML: one receiving oral decitabine-cedazuridine (DEC-C, n\u2009=\u200973) and one receiving DEC-C and Ven (DEC-C-Ven, n\u2009=\u200951), in three contemporary clinical trials.

      "abstract": "The DNA methyltransferase inhibitors azacitidine and decitabine for individuals with myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia are available in parenteral form. Oral therapy with similar exposure for these diseases would offer potential treatment benefits. We aimed to compare the safety and pharmacokinetics of oral decitabine plus the cytidine deaminase inhibitor cedazuridine versus intravenous decitabine. We did a registrational, multicentre, open-label, crossover, phase 3 trial of individuals with myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and individuals with acute myeloid leukaemia, enrolled as separate cohorts; results for only participants with myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia are reported here. In 37 academic and community-based clinics in Canada and the USA, we enrolled individuals aged 18 years or older who were candidates to receive intravenous decitabine, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1 and a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 5 days of oral decitabine-cedazuridine (one tablet once daily containing 35 mg decitabine and 100 mg cedazuridine as a fixed-dose combination) or intravenous decitabine (20 mg/m Between Feb 8, 2018, and June 7, 2021, 173 individuals were screened, 138 (80%) participants were randomly assigned to a treatment sequence, and 133 (96%) participants (87 [65%] men and 46 [35%] women; 121 [91%] White, four [3%] Black or African-American, three [2%] Asian, and five [4%] not reported) received treatment. Median follow-up was 966 days (IQR 917-1050). Primary endpoint of total exposure of oral decitabine-cedazuridine versus intravenous decitabine was 98\u00b793% (90% CI 92\u00b766-105\u00b760), indicating equivalent pharmacokinetic exposure on the basis of area under the curve. The safety profiles of oral decitabine-cedazuridine and intravenous decitabine were similar. The most frequent adverse events of grade 3 or worse were thrombocytopenia (81 [61%] of 133 participants), neutropenia (76 [57%] participants), and anaemia (67 [50%] participants). The incidence of serious adverse events in cycles 1-2 was 31% (40 of 130 participants) with oral decitabine-cedazuridine and 18% (24 of 132 participants) with intravenous decitabine. There were five treatment-related deaths; two deemed related to oral therapy (sepsis and pneumonia) and three to intravenous treatment (septic shock [n=2] and pneumonia [n=1]). Oral decitabine-cedazuridine was pharmacologically and pharmacodynamically equivalent to intravenous decitabine. The results support use of oral decitabine-cedazuridine as a safe and effective alternative to intravenous decitabine for treatment of individuals with myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia.

Oral therapy with similar exposure for these diseases would offer potential treatment benefits. We aimed to compare the safety and pharmacokinetics of oral decitabine plus the cytidine deaminase inhibitor cedazuridine versus intravenous decitabine. We did a registrational, multicentre, open-label, crossover, phase 3 trial of individuals with myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and individuals with acute myeloid leukaemia, enrolled as separate cohorts; results for only participants with myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia are reported here. In 37 academic and community-based clinics in Canada and the USA, we enrolled individuals aged 18 years or older who were candidates to receive intravenous decitabine, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1 and a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 5 days of oral decitabine-cedazuridine (one tablet once daily containing 35 mg decitabine and 100 mg cedazuridine as a fixed-dose combination) or intravenous decitabine (20 mg/m Between Feb 8, 2018, and June 7, 2021, 173 individuals were screened, 138 (80%) participants were randomly assigned to a treatment sequence, and 133 (96%) participants (87 [65%] men and 46 [35%] women; 121 [91%] White, four [3%] Black or African-American, three [2%] Asian, and five [4%] not reported) received treatment. Median follow-up was 966 days (IQR 917-1050). Primary endpoint of total exposure of oral decitabine-cedazuridine versus intravenous decitabine was 98\u00b793% (90% CI 92\u00b766-105\u00b760), indicating equivalent pharmacokinetic exposure on the basis of area under the curve. The safety profiles of oral decitabine-cedazuridine and intravenous decitabine were similar. The most frequent adverse events of grade 3 or worse were thrombocytopenia (81 [61%] of 133 participants), neutropenia (76 [57%] participants), and anaemia (67 [50%] participants). The incidence of serious adverse events in cycles 1-2 was 31% (40 of 130 participants) with oral decitabine-cedazuridine and 18% (24 of 132 participants) with intravenous decitabine. There were five treatment-related deaths; two deemed related to oral therapy (sepsis and pneumonia) and three to intravenous treatment (septic shock [n=2] and pneumonia [n=1]). Oral decitabine-cedazuridine was pharmacologically and pharmacodynamically equivalent to intravenous decitabine. The results support use of oral decitabine-cedazuridine as a safe and effective alternative to intravenous decitabine for treatment of individuals with myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia.

We evaluated pretreatment HbF levels in AZA monotherapy as a prognostic marker in MDS/acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods This study included chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients who had received seven-day treatment schedules of AZA and whose HbF levels were measured at the onset of treatment between March 2011 and July 2020. Patients were grouped into HbF-normal (<1.0%) or HbF-elevated (\u22651.0%) groups. Responses were classified according to the International Working Group 2006 criteria. Patients Twenty-nine patients were included and classified as having either MDS (n=21), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n=5), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm unclassifiable (n=1), or AML with <30% marrow blasts (n=2) based on the World Health Organization 2016 diagnostic criteria.

After an extensive workup, he was diagnosed with AML/CMML (chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) with a normal karyotype with DNMT3A, CBFB, and PTPN11 mutations. Further workup of the polyuria with a water deprivation test helped confirm the diagnosis of CDI along with MRI findings suggestive of hypophysitis.

We performed next-generation sequencing on bone marrow aspiration samples of 59 patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts-2, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and treated with decitabine or azacitidine as a frontline therapy. A single gene with the most common mutations was TP53 (14 of 59 patients), and mutations in RAS pathway-related genes including KRAS, NRAS, FLT3, PTPN11, CBL, and KIT were found in 28.8% of patients. The overall response rate to HMAs was 33.9%. Predictive factors for a poor response were an age >75 years (p = 0.007), 3 or more gene mutations (p = 0.004), mutations in RAS pathway-related genes (p = 0.033), and a mutated NRAS gene (p = 0.042). An age >75 years (hazard ratio 2.946), diagnosis of AML (hazard ratio 2.915), and mutations in NRAS (hazard ratio 4.440) were identified as poor prognostic factors for survival.

Because of vast clinical heterogeneity in presentation and course, risk stratification is used for a risk-adapted treatment strategy. Numerous prognostic scoring systems exist, some of which incorporate mutational information. Treatment ranges from observation to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Therapies include hydroxyurea for cytoreduction, hypomethylating agents, and the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib to address splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms. Recently, oral decitabine with cedazuridine was approved and represents a convenient treatment option for CMML patients. Although novel therapeutics are in development for CMML, further work is needed to elucidate possible targets unique to the CMML clone. In this review, we will detail the pathophysiology, risk stratification, available treatment modalities, and novel therapies for CMML, and propose a modern treatment algorithm. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clinically heterogenous disease, which poses significant management challenges. The diagnosis of CMML requires bone marrow biopsy and aspirate with thorough evaluation. Risk stratification and symptom assessment are essential to designing an effective treatment plan, which may include hypomethylating agents (HMAs) in intermediate or high-risk patients. The recently approved oral decitabine/cedazuridine provides a convenient alternative to parenteral HMAs. Ruxolitinib may be effective in ameliorating proliferative symptoms and splenomegaly. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only treatment with curative potential; however, novel therapies are in clinical development which may significantly alter the therapeutic landscape of CMML.",

Decitabine treatment was also associated with higher incidence of transfusion independence (42% vs. 20%, P=0.044).

      "abstract": "Venetoclax combined with hypomethylating agents is a new standard of care for newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are 75 years or older, or unfit for intensive chemotherapy. Pharmacodynamic studies have suggested superiority of the longer 10-day regimen of decitabine that has shown promising results in patients with high-risk AML in phase 2 trials. We hypothesised that venetoclax with 10-day decitabine could have improved activity in patients with newly diagnosed AML and those with relapsed or refractory AML, particularly in high-risk subgroups. This single centre, phase 2 trial was done at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). The study enrolled older patients (aged >60 years) with newly diagnosed AML, not eligible for intensive chemotherapy; secondary AML (progressed after myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia); and relapsed or refractory AML. Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 3 or less, white blood cell count less than 10\u2008\u00d7\u200810 Between Jan 19, 2018, and Dec 16, 2019, we enrolled 168 patients; 70 (42%) had newly diagnosed AML, 15 (9%) had untreated secondary AML, 28 (17%) had treated secondary AML, and 55 (33%) had relapsed or refractory AML. The median age was 71 years (IQR 65-76) and 30% of patients had ECOG performance status of 2 or higher. The median follow-up for all patients was 16 months (95% CI 12-18; actual follow-up 6\u00b75 months; IQR 3\u00b74-12\u00b74). The overall response rate was 74% (125 of 168 patients; 95% CI 67-80) and in disease subgroups were: 89% in newly diagnosed AML (62 of 70 patients; 79-94), 80% in untreated secondary AML (12 of 15 patients; 55-93), 61% in treated secondary AML (17 of 28 patients; 42-76), and 62% in relapsed or refractory AML (34 of 55 patients; 49-74). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included infections with grades 3 or 4 neutropenia (n=79, 47%) and febrile neutropenia (n=49, 29%). 139 (83%) of 168 patients had serious adverse events, most frequently neutropenic fever (n=63, 38%), followed by pneumonia (n=17, 10%) and sepsis (n=16, 10%). The 30-day mortality for all patients was 3\u00b76% (n=6, 95% CI 1\u00b77-7\u00b78). The median overall survival was 18\u00b71 months (95% CI 10\u00b70-not reached) in newly diagnosed AML, 7\u00b78 months (2\u00b79-10\u00b77) in untreated secondary AML, 6\u00b70 months (3\u00b74-13\u00b77) in treated secondary AML, and 7\u00b78 months (5\u00b74-13\u00b73) relapsed or refractory AML. The median duration of response was not reached (95% CI 9\u00b70-not reached) in newly diagnosed AML, 5\u00b71 months (95% CI 0\u00b79-not reached) in untreated secondary AML, not reached (95% CI 2\u00b75-not reached) in previously treated secondary AML, and 16\u00b78 months (95% CI 6\u00b76-not reached) in relapsed or refractory AML. Venetoclax with 10-day decitabine has a manageable safety profile and showed high activity in newly diagnosed AML and molecularly defined subsets of relapsed or refractory AML. Future larger and randomised studies are needed to clarify activity in high-risk subsets. US National Institutes of Health and National Cancer Institute.",

In the current retrospective study, we assessed response rates as adjudicated by the IWG (International Working Group) MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) and MDS/MPN myeloproliferative neoplasm overlap syndrome response criteria, in 121 CMML patients treated with Azacitidine (AZA, n = 56) and Decitabine (DAC, n = 65). The overall response rates were 41% by the IWG MDS (AZA- 45%, DAC-39%), and 56% by the IWG MDS/MPN (AZA-56%, DAC-58%) response criteria, with CR (complete remission) rates of <20% for both agents, by both criteria. There were no significant differences in response rates between proliferative and dysplastic CMML. Moreover, 29% of CMML patients in a CR with HMA progressed to AML (blast transformation), underscoring the limited impact of these agents on disease biology. Progression after HMA response was associated with a median overall-survival (OS) of 8 months, while median OS in patients with primary HMA failure was 4 months. Lower serum LDH levels (<250 Units/L) were associated with HMA responses by both criteria; while ASXL1 and TET2 mutational status had no impact. HMA treated patients had a longer median OS (31 vs 18\u2009months; P = .01), in comparison to those treated with conventional care regimens (excluding observation only patients), without any differences between AZA vs DAC (P = .37). In conclusion, this study highlights the inadequacies of HMA therapy in CMML, retrospectively validates the IWG MDS/MPN response criteria and underscores the need for newer, rationally derived therapies.",

In the current retrospective study, we assessed response rates as adjudicated by the IWG (International Working Group) MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) and MDS/MPN myeloproliferative neoplasm overlap syndrome response criteria, in 121 CMML patients treated with Azacitidine (AZA, n = 56) and Decitabine (DAC, n = 65). The overall response rates were 41% by the IWG MDS (AZA- 45%, DAC-39%), and 56% by the IWG MDS/MPN (AZA-56%, DAC-58%) response criteria, with CR (complete remission) rates of <20% for both agents, by both criteria. There were no significant differences in response rates between proliferative and dysplastic CMML. Moreover, 29% of CMML patients in a CR with HMA progressed to AML (blast transformation), underscoring the limited impact of these agents on disease biology. Progression after HMA response was associated with a median overall-survival (OS) of 8 months, while median OS in patients with primary HMA failure was 4 months. Lower serum LDH levels (<250 Units/L) were associated with HMA responses by both criteria; while ASXL1 and TET2 mutational status had no impact. HMA treated patients had a longer median OS (31 vs 18\u2009months; P = .01), in comparison to those treated with conventional care regimens (excluding observation only patients), without any differences between AZA vs DAC (P = .37). In conclusion, this study highlights the inadequacies of HMA therapy in CMML, retrospectively validates the IWG MDS/MPN response criteria and underscores the need for newer, rationally derived therapies.",

This dose-escalation study, guided by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic observations, evaluated whether simultaneous oral administration with the novel CDA inhibitor cedazuridine increases decitabine bioavailability for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. In this phase 1 study, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. Eligible patients were assigned to cohorts to receive escalating oral doses of decitabine and cedazuridine. The starting dose was decitabine 20 mg and cedazuridine 40 mg. Treatment cycles lasted 28 days, with 5 days of drug administration. In cycle 1, each patient received a cohort-defined dose of oral decitabine on day -3, a 1-h intravenous infusion of decitabine 20 mg/m Between Oct 28, 2014, and Nov 13, 2015, we enrolled 44 eligible patients (of 75 screened) with previously treated or newly diagnosed myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia; 43 of the enrolled patients were evaluable. Participants were treated in five cohorts: cohorts 1-4 included six evaluable patients each; cohort 5 included 19 patients in a 13-patient expansion. Dose-dependent increases in decitabine AUC and peak plasma concentration occurred with each cohort dose escalation. There was no evident increase in toxicity compared with that reported for intravenous decitabine. Decitabine 30 mg and 40 mg plus cedazuridine 100 mg produced mean day-5 decitabine AUCs (146 ng\u2008\u00d7\u2008h/mL for decitabine 30 mg, and 221 ng\u2008\u00d7\u2008h/mL for decitabine 40 mg) closest to the mean intravenous-decitabine AUC (164 ng\u2008\u00d7\u2008h/mL). The most common grade 3 or more adverse events were thrombocytopenia (18 [41%] of 44 patients), neutropenia (13 [30%]), anaemia (11 [25%]), leukopenia (seven [16%]), febrile neutropenia (seven [16%]), and pneumonia (seven [16%]). Four (9%) patients died because of adverse events, none of which was considered drug related, and three (7%) patients died more than 30 days after discontinuing treatment because of progressive disease (two [5%]) and respiratory failure (one [2%]). Oral decitabine plus cedazuridine emulated the pharmacokinetics of intravenous decitabine, with a similar safety profile and dose-dependent demethylation. Clinical responses were similar to intravenous decitabine treatment for 5 days. Further study of decitabine plus cedazuridine as an alternative to parenteral therapy or in combination with other new oral agents for myeloid disorders is warranted. Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",

We present the largest retrospective series of CMML (n\u2009=\u2009151) treated with HMA. Mean age at diagnosis was 69 years (range 50-88). According to the CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS): 17 (15%) were low-risk, 45 (39%) intermediate-1 risk, 42 (36%) intermediate-2, and 12 (10%) high-risk. 35 (23%) patients received single agent azacitidine, 73 (48%) single agent decitabine, and 43 (29%) combinations. With a median follow-up of 17 months, overall response rate (ORR) was 75%, with 41% achieving complete response (CR).

By multivariate analysis, age\u2009<\u200970 years, higher levels of hemoglobin, absence of blast in peripheral blood and lower CPSS cytogenetic risk predicted for better OS.

Survival is poor after failure of these drugs; there is no approved second-line therapy. We compared the overall survival of patients receiving rigosertib and best supportive care with that of patients receiving best supportive care only in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes with excess blasts after failure of azacitidine or decitabine treatment. We did this randomised controlled trial at 74 hospitals and university medical centres in the USA and Europe. We enrolled patients with diagnosis of refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB)-1, RAEB-2, RAEB-t, or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia based on local site assessment, and treatment failure with a hypomethylating drug in the past 2 years. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive rigosertib 1800 mg per 24 h via 72-h continuous intravenous infusion administered every other week or best supportive care with or without low-dose cytarabine. Randomisation was stratified by pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01241500. From Dec 13, 2010, to Aug 15, 2013, we enrolled 299 patients: 199 assigned to rigosertib, 100 assigned to best supportive care. Median follow-up was 19\u00b75 months (IQR 11\u00b79-27\u00b73). As of Feb 1, 2014, median overall survival was 8\u00b72 months (95% CI 6\u00b71-10\u00b71) in the rigosertib group and 5\u00b79 months (4\u00b71-9\u00b73) in the best supportive care group (hazard ratio 0\u00b787, 95% CI 0\u00b767-1\u00b714; p=0\u00b733). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were anaemia (34 [18%] of 184 patients in the rigosertib group vs seven [8%] of 91 patients in the best supportive care group), thrombocytopenia (35 [19%] vs six [7%]), neutropenia (31 [17%] vs seven [8%]), febrile neutropenia (22 [12%] vs ten [11%]), and pneumonia (22 [12%] vs ten [11%]). 41 (22%) of 184 patients in the rigosertib group and 30 (33%) of 91 patients in the best supportive care group died due to adverse events and three deaths were attributed to rigosertib treatment. Rigosertib did not significantly improve overall survival compared with best supportive care. A randomised phase 3 trial of rigosertib (NCT 02562443) is underway in specific subgroups of patients deemed to be at high risk, including patients with very high risk per the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System criteria.

Survival is poor after failure of these drugs; there is no approved second-line therapy. We compared the overall survival of patients receiving rigosertib and best supportive care with that of patients receiving best supportive care only in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes with excess blasts after failure of azacitidine or decitabine treatment. We did this randomised controlled trial at 74 hospitals and university medical centres in the USA and Europe. We enrolled patients with diagnosis of refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB)-1, RAEB-2, RAEB-t, or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia based on local site assessment, and treatment failure with a hypomethylating drug in the past 2 years. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive rigosertib 1800 mg per 24 h via 72-h continuous intravenous infusion administered every other week or best supportive care with or without low-dose cytarabine. Randomisation was stratified by pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment assignment.

Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporin A and mycophenolate mofetil. At a median follow-up of 443\u00a0days, the overall survival was 53%, relapse incidence was 27%, and nonrelapse mortality was 27%.

The objective of our study was to evaluate efficacy of decitabine after azacitidine failure in a relatively large patient cohort based on conflicting results with 0-28% response rates (RR) in this setting in small patient series. Thirty-six consecutive high risk MDS and CMML patients who received decitabine after azacitidine failure were retrospectively reviewed. Response was based on IWG 2006 criteria for MDS and CMML with WBC<13G/l and also included for proliferative CMML the evolution of WBC, splenomegaly (SMG) and extramedullary disease (EMD). Patients received a median number of 3 (range 1-27) cycles of decitabine and 12 patients received at least 6 cycles. Seven (19.4%) patients were responders including 3 marrow CR (mCR), 2 stable disease (SD) with HI-E, 1 SD with HI-N and HI-P and 1 SD with HI-N. In a CMML patient with SD, specific skin lesions resolved with decitabine. Responses were generally short lived (2-5 months) except 1 responder currently ongoing with +11 months follow up. Two non-responders had prolonged SD (without HI) of 21 and 27 months duration respectively. Median OS from onset of decitabine was 7.3 months, without significant difference between responders and non-responders. Treatment with decitabine after azacitidine failure yielded modest ORR (19.4%) with short response duration and poor OS. Thus, use of decitabine in such patients who failed or progressed after azacitidine cannot be recommended, underscoring the need for novel strategies in this setting.",

The objective of our study was to evaluate efficacy of decitabine after azacitidine failure in a relatively large patient cohort based on conflicting results with 0-28% response rates (RR) in this setting in small patient series. Thirty-six consecutive high risk MDS and CMML patients who received decitabine after azacitidine failure were retrospectively reviewed. Response was based on IWG 2006 criteria for MDS and CMML with WBC<13G/l and also included for proliferative CMML the evolution of WBC, splenomegaly (SMG) and extramedullary disease (EMD). Patients received a median number of 3 (range 1-27) cycles of decitabine and 12 patients received at least 6 cycles. Seven (19.4%) patients were responders including 3 marrow CR (mCR), 2 stable disease (SD) with HI-E, 1 SD with HI-N and HI-P and 1 SD with HI-N. In a CMML patient with SD, specific skin lesions resolved with decitabine. Responses were generally short lived (2-5 months) except 1 responder currently ongoing with +11 months follow up. Two non-responders had prolonged SD (without HI) of 21 and 27 months duration respectively. Median OS from onset of decitabine was 7.3 months, without significant difference between responders and non-responders. Treatment with decitabine after azacitidine failure yielded modest ORR (19.4%) with short response duration and poor OS. Thus, use of decitabine in such patients who failed or progressed after azacitidine cannot be recommended, underscoring the need for novel strategies in this setting.",

Aberrant upregulation (\u2a7e2-fold) was observed in 34, 14, 15 and 8% of the patients. Increased expression of these four genes was also observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) (N=61). The relative expression of PD-L1 from PBMNC was significantly higher in MDS (P=0.018) and CMML (P=0.0128) compared with AML. By immunohistochemical analysis, PD-L1 protein expression was observed in MDS CD34+ cells, whereas stroma/non-blast cellular compartment was positive for PD-1. In a cohort of patients treated with epigenetic therapy, PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1 and CTLA4 expression was upregulated.

It is important to exclude other myeloproliferative neoplasms and infectious/autoimmune conditions that can cause monocytosis. Several CMML-specific prognostic models incorporating novel mutations have been recently reported. The Mayo prognostic model classified CMML patients into three risk groups based on: increased absolute monocyte count, presence of circulating blasts, hemoglobin <10 gm/dL and platelets <100\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2079/L. The median survival was 32 months, 18.5 months and 10 months in the low, intermediate, and high-risk groups, respectively. The Groupe Francophone des (GFM) score segregated CMML patients into three risk groups based on: age >65 years, WBC >15\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2079/L, anemia, platelets <100\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2079/L, and ASXL1 mutation status.

Response to hypomethylating agents has been reported in heterogeneous series of CMML. We conducted a phase 2 trial of decitabine (DAC) in 39 patients with advanced CMML defined according to a previous trial. Median number of DAC cycles was 10 (range, 1-24). Overall response rate was 38% with 4 complete responses (10%), 8 marrow responses (21%), and 3 stable diseases with hematologic improvement (8%). Eighteen patients (46%) demonstrated stable disease without hematologic improvement, and 6 (15%) progressed to acute leukemia. With a median follow-up of 23 months, overall survival was 48% at 2 years. Mutations in ASXL1, TET2, AML1, NRAS, KRAS, CBL, FLT3, and janus kinase 2 (JAK2) genes, and hypermethylation of the promoter of the tumor suppressor gene TIF1\u03b3, did not predict response or survival on DAC therapy. Lower CJUN and CMYB gene expression levels independently predicted improved overall survival. This trial confirmed DAC efficacy in approximately 40% of CMML patients with advanced myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic features and suggested that CJUN and CMYB expression could be potential biomarkers in this setting. This trial is registered at EudraCT (eudract.ema.europa.eu) as #2008-000470-21 and www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01098084.",

With a median follow-up of 23 months, overall survival was 48% at 2 years. Mutations in ASXL1, TET2, AML1, NRAS, KRAS, CBL, FLT3, and janus kinase 2 (JAK2) genes, and hypermethylation of the promoter of the tumor suppressor gene TIF1\u03b3, did not predict response or survival on DAC therapy. Lower CJUN and CMYB gene expression levels independently predicted improved overall survival. This trial confirmed DAC efficacy in approximately 40% of CMML patients with advanced myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic features and suggested that CJUN and CMYB expression could be potential biomarkers in this setting. This trial is registered at EudraCT (eudract.ema.europa.eu) as #2008-000470-21 and www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01098084.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azacitidine in the treatment of CMML. The records of thirty-eight patients diagnosed with CMML and treated with azacitidine at our institution were reviewed. Azacitidine was administered at 75 mg/m(2) /day for 7 days or 100 mg/m(2) /day for 5 days every 4 weeks. Patients who received at least 1 cycle of the drug were considered evaluable for response.

The overall response rate was 39% (14 of 36); complete response (CR) rate was 11% (4 of 36); partial response (PR) rate was 3% (1 of 36); hematologic improvement (HI) was 25% (9 of 36). The median overall survival was 12 months. There was a statistically significant overall survival advantage in responders compared with nonresponders: 15.5 months versus 9 months, respectively (P = .04). Treatment was generally well tolerated. One of 2 patients had complete resolution of a skin rash that was due to monocytic infiltration. Azacitidine is active in the treatment of CMML.

      "abstract": "Methylation of DNA at 5-position of cytosine, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases, is the predominant epigenetic modification in mammals. Aberrations in methylation play a causal role in a variety of diseases, including cancer. Recent studies have established that like mutation, methylation-mediated gene silencing often leads to tumorigenesis. Paradoxically, genome-wide DNA hypomethylation may also play a causal role in carcinogenesis by inducing chromosomal instability and spurious gene expression. Since methylation does not alter DNA base sequence, much attention has been focused recently on developing small molecule inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases that can potentially be used as anticancer agents. Vidaza (5-azacytidine), marketed by Pharmion (Boulder, CO, USA), was the first DNA methyltransferase inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for chemotherapy against myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a heterogeneous bone marrow disorder. Recently MGI Pharma Inc. (Bloomington, MN, USA) got FDA approval to market Dacogen (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, or decitabine) for treating MDS patients. These drugs were used earlier against certain anemias to induce expression of fetal globin genes. Interest in clinical trials of these drugs as anticancer agents has been renewed only recently because of reversal of methylation-mediated silencing of critical genes in cancer. Clinical trials have shown that both drugs have therapeutic potential against leukemia such as MDS, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. In contrast, their effectiveness with solid tumors appears to be less promising, which challenges researchers to develop inhibitors with more efficacy and less toxicity. The major hindrance of their usage as anticancer agents is their instability in vivo as well as the toxicity secondary to their excessive incorporation into DNA, which causes cell cycle arrest. Gene expression profiling in cancer cells revealed that antineoplastic property of these drugs is mediated through both methylation-dependent and -independent pathways. Recently, we have shown that treatment of cancer cells with these cytidine analogues also induces proteasomal degradation of DNA methyltransferase 1, the ubiquitously expressed enzyme upregulated in almost all cancer cells. Development of related stable drugs that can facilitate gene activation in cancer cells by enhancing degradation of DNA methyltransferases without being incorporated into DNA would be ideal for chemotherapy.

The objective of the current study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity profiles of decitabine and intensive chemotherapy in MDS. The authors compared lower intensity decitabine therapy (n = 115 patients) with intensive chemotherapy (as it is used in acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) in patients with higher risk MDS. Two comparisons were made with a cohort of 376 historic patients (from 1995 to 2005): The first comparison included a subcohort of 115 patients (Group A) who matched the 115 decitabine study patients according to age, International Prognostic Scoring System, and cytogenetics; and the second comparison included the whole cohort of 376 patients without matching (Group B). A multivariate analysis was performed for outcome. The complete remission (CR) rate according to AML criteria was 43% with decitabine, 46% with intensive chemotherapy in Group A, and 52% with intensive chemotherapy in Group B. Compared with Group A, mortality at 6 weeks was 3% with decitabine versus 13% with intensive chemotherapy (P = .006) and, at 3 months, 7% with decitabine versus 23% with intensive chemotherapy (P = .001). Survival was better with decitabine versus intensive chemotherapy in Group A (median survival: 22 months vs 12 months; P < .001). A multivariate analysis of survival in all 491 patients who received decitabine or intensive chemotherapy (Group B) selected decitabine as an independent, favorable prognostic factor for survival (P = .006; hazard ratio, 0.74) after accounting for the independent prognostic effect of pretreatment factors. In this analysis, decitabine was associated with a survival advantage compared with intensive chemotherapy in patients with higher risk MDS.

Compared with Group A, mortality at 6 weeks was 3% with decitabine versus 13% with intensive chemotherapy (P = .006) and, at 3 months, 7% with decitabine versus 23% with intensive chemotherapy (P = .001). Survival was better with decitabine versus intensive chemotherapy in Group A (median survival: 22 months vs 12 months; P < .001). A multivariate analysis of survival in all 491 patients who received decitabine or intensive chemotherapy (Group B) selected decitabine as an independent, favorable prognostic factor for survival (P = .006; hazard ratio, 0.74) after accounting for the independent prognostic effect of pretreatment factors. In this analysis, decitabine was associated with a survival advantage compared with intensive chemotherapy in patients with higher risk MDS. Future studies should evaluate prospectively the results of decitabine versus intensive chemotherapy in this setting.",

We examined the incidence and kinetics of cytogenetic responses to decitabine in these patients. Of 115 successfully karyotyped patients, 61 (53%) had clonal chromosomal abnormalities prior to treatment. Major cytogenetic responses were observed in 19 patients (31% of those with abnormal cytogenetics, 17% of all patients by intention-to-treat) after a median of three courses (range, 2-6) until best cytogenetic response. Progressive decrease of the abnormal clone over time was also determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis in two patients. Median duration of cytogenetic responses was 7.5 months (range, 3-15). Analysis of response by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) cytogenetic risk groups revealed three out of five cytogenetic responses (60%) in the IPSS 'low-risk' group, 6 out of 30 with 'intermediate risk' (20%) and 10 out of 26 in the 'high-risk' group (38%). Median survival in these cytogenetic subgroups was 30, 8 and 13 months respectively. The relative risk of death in patients achieving a major cytogenetic response was 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.88) compared with patients in whom the cytogenetically abnormal clone persisted (P = 0.0213).

Sixty patients with a diagnosis of MDS (n = 30) or CMML (n = 30) were treated. Their median age was 66 years, with 50 patients (83%) being over 60 years of age at time of study entry. Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 50% of patients and thrombocytopenia of less than 50 x 10(9)/L in 50%. Topotecan was administered as 2 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for five days (10 mg/m2 per course) every 4 to 6 weeks for two courses, then at maximum tolerated dose level (1-2 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for five days) once every 4-8 weeks for a maximum of 12 courses. Evaluation of outcome and of differences among subgroups was performed according to standard methods; the criteria for response were those used for acute leukemia. Nineteen patients (31%) achieved a complete response (CR). A CR was achieved in 11 of 30 patients with MDS (37%) and in eight of 30 with CMML (27%). A CR was achieved in 10 of 23 patients with previously untreated MDS (43%). Eight of 11 patients who presented with cytogenetic abnormalities (five of which involved chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities) and achieved CR, were evaluated cytogenetically in CR: all were cytogenetically normal in CR. Characteristics associated with a higher CR rate were lack of previous chemotherapy, absence of ras oncogene mutations, and presence of less than 10% monocytes in either peripheral blood or bone marrow. In contrast, CR rates were similar by different agent groups, by different karyotype abnormalities, and by other pre-therapy peripheral blood counts. Non-myelosuppressive side effects were mucositis in 67% of patients (severe [grade 3-4] 23%), diarrhea in 38% (severe 17%), and nausea and vomiting in 28% (severe 5%). Febrile episodes during neutropenia occurred in 85% of patients and documented infections in 47 %. Mortality in the first four weeks was 20%. With a median follow-up duration of 31 months, the 12 month survival rate was 38%, median survival time 10.5 months, and median remission duration 7.5 months. In summary, topotecan has significant single-agent activity in MDS and CMML. Complete responses associated with topotecan therapy often involve the disappearance of abnormal, poor-prognosis karyotypes, which is particularly encouraging. Future strategies to optimize topotecan's role include combination regimens with topoisomerase II reactive agents, cytarabine, or hypomethylating agents (azacytidine and decitabine).",
