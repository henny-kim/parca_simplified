    "abstract": "Enasidenib is an oral IDH2 inhibitor that reduces the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, differentiating IDH2 mutated leukemic cells with initial promising results for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. We performed a retrospective study in Spain evaluating enasidenib in patients diagnosed with IDH2-mutated myeloid neoplasms (AML, MDS, myeloid sarcoma and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Twenty-three patients were included, with 20 having a refractory/relapsed (R/R) disease status. The median age was 73 years, and the majority patients were classified as adverse risk by the European LeukemiaNet 2022 criteria. The most frequent mutation was IDH2 R140 (69.6%), while 30.4% had R172 mutation. Enasidenib was administered as a single agent in 18 patients, in combination with azacitidine in four patients, and with low-dose cytarabine in another one. The median number of cycles administered was four, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 39.1% and a morphological complete remission (CR) rate of 26.1%. Median overall survival (OS) was 8.3 months. Patients who achieved a complete response had a better outcome than the rest of the patients in terms of OS (19.8 months (95%CI: 15.7-NR) vs. 4.2 (95%CI: 1.5-NR), p\u2009=\u20090.01). Drug-related events included leukocytosis in five patients (21.7%), hyperbilirubinemia in six patients (26.1%) and differentiation syndrome (DS) in four patients (17.4%), including one grade 3 DS and one death related to this latter adverse event (AE), similar to previous findings. Although enasidenib failed to demonstrate a clear overall survival advantage in phase 3 trials, the extended responses and long-term survivors observed herein underscore its therapeutic potential. Ultimately, our data support enasidenib's role as a targeted therapy for IDH2-mutated AML, indicating that expanded access to this agent is warranted to optimize outcomes in these challenging patient populations, especially for R/R AML patients.",

    "abstract": "Atraumatic splenic rupture (ASR) is rare and typically attributed to underlying pathological conditions, with neoplastic diseases being the main etiologies. Traditionally, surgical intervention has been the standard approach for managing ASR in the majority of patients. However, reports on the outcomes of conservative management, especially for ASR related to myeloid neoplasms, are scarce. Here, we present two case reports involving ASR associated with myeloid neoplasms. The first patient, suffering from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) harboring CBL and ASXL1 mutations, developed ASR shortly after receiving treatment with the hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine. The second patient, in the blast phase of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), experienced ASR during the progression of their disease. In the initial case, despite experiencing intense abdominal pain and hypovolemic shock, the patient responded favorably to prompt fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion upon, thanks to a timely diagnosis. A non-operative management approach successfully averted the need for splenectomy or arterial embolism, leading to a favorable outcome. In the second case, the patient presented with progressive abdominal pain but remained hemodynamic stability throughout the ASR episode. We opted for a cautious approach, prioritizing resuscitation, close monitoring, and a watchful waiting strategy. Regrettably, the patient's condition deteriorated, marked by increasing splenomegaly, unchecked leukocytosis, and recurrent parenchymal hemorrhages. Here, we report two cases of ASR in myeloid neoplasms, demonstrating that patients may achieve acceptable outcomes with conservative management.",

The combination of hypomethylating agents with venetoclax (Ven) has demonstrated promising results in these diseases, although randomized clinical trials are needed for validation. In this retrospective study, we compared two matched cohorts of patients with MDS or CMML: one receiving oral decitabine-cedazuridine (DEC-C, n\u2009=\u200973) and one receiving DEC-C and Ven (DEC-C-Ven, n\u2009=\u200951), in three contemporary clinical trials. The aim is to determine the impact of the addition of Ven to HMA in MDS and CMML. Individuals were matched using a propensity score approach that was based on the IPSS-M score and age. All patients had excess blasts; 84% were diagnosed with MDS and 16% with CMML. Most patients had high- or very high-risk disease, according to the revised IPSS-R. The overall response rate was superior in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (90% vs 64%, P\u2009=\u20090.002).

Although epigenetic mechanisms are assumed, responding patients' epigenomes have not been thoroughly examined. We aimed to clarify HbF kinetics and prognostic value for azacytidine treated patients, as well as the epigenetic landscape that might influence HbF re-expression and its clinical relevance. Serial HbF measurements by high-performance liquid chromatography (n\u2009=\u200920) showed induction of HbF only among responders (p\u2009=\u20090.030). Moreover, HbF increase immediately after the first azacytidine cycle demonstrated prognostic value for progression-free survival (PFS) (p\u2009=\u20090.032, HR\u2009=\u20090.19, CI 0.24-1.63).

More recently, the true nature of the myeloid cells present in the cutaneous infiltrates of this theoretically reactive dermatitis is being clarified with the use of new molecular techniques such as next-generation sequencing. The same mutations in bone marrow (BM) myeloid neoplastic cells and in the cells of cutaneous infiltrates have been found. We present the case of a 77-year-old man who presented with spread and treatment-resistant skin granulomatous lesions previous to the diagnosis of CMML. The same clonal mutations in SRSF2, IDH1, and RUNX1 were found in both skin and BM with resolution of the lesions after the initiation of azacytidine. In conclusion, we report an exceptional case in which specific granulomatous cutaneous lesions have preceded and allowed the earlier diagnosis of an underlying CMML and a review of all previous similar cases in the literature, including molecular alterations.",

Our case report explores the rare coexistence of CMML with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in a 63-year-old female patient. CMML diagnosis followed World Health Organization criteria, and the patient was classified as having high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-CMML stage 2. Initial treatment with subcutaneous azacytidine for CMML proved partially effective, highlighting persistent severe thrombocytopenia. Subsequent investigations revealed secondary ITP associated with Crohn's disease. Conventional ITP therapies, including high-dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin, showed limited efficacy. Eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, was initiated, resulting in the normalization of platelet counts within six weeks. Our case emphasizes the diagnostic challenges and intricate treatment landscape of CMML-associated ITP, suggesting eltrombopag as a potential therapeutic option in refractory cases.

The hedgehog (HH) pathway is one of the main pathways for cancer stem cells survival and several HH inhibitors (HHi) are approved in clinical practice. Sonidegib (SON), an oral HHi, was tested in this phase 1/1b trial in combination with azacitidine (AZA, 75 mg/m Sixty-two patients (28 [45%] newly diagnosed) were treated in this study, including 10 patients in the dose-finding component and 52 patients in phase 1b. SON 200 mg oral daily on days 1-28 each cycle was deemed the recommended dose for phase 1b. Out of 21 rrAML patients, two achieved response (one complete response/one morphologic leukemia-free state) with no responses seen in seven r/r MDS/CMML patients. In newly diagnosed AML/MDS, response was seen in six (three had complete remission, two had morphological leukemia-free status) of 27 patients. Median overall survival was 26.4 and 4.7 months for newly diagnosed MDS and AML, respectively. Safety was satisfactory with common (>20%) side effects including fatigue, constipation, nausea, cough, insomnia, and diarrhea. Only 7% of patients died in the study, and none of the deaths were deemed related to treatment. Our study shows that AZA + SON are a safe combination in a patient with MN.

Hence, we aimed to reveal the frequence of infections, predisposing factors of infection and to analyse infection attributable mortality in patients with high-risk MDS, CMML and AML who received hypomethylating agents in our center where routine infection prophylaxis is not applied. 43 adult patients with AML or high-risk MDS or CMML who received HMA \u2265\u00a02 consecutive cycles from January 2014 to December 2020 were enrolled in the study. 43 patients and 173 treatment cycles were analyzed.

The only approved disease-modifying therapies for any of the MDS/MPN are DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) for patients with dysplastic CMML, and still, outcomes are generally poor, making this an important area of unmet clinical need. Due to both the rarity and the heterogeneous nature of MDS/MPN, they have been challenging to study in dedicated prospective studies. Thus, refining first-line treatment strategies has been difficult, and optimal salvage treatments following DNMTi failure have also not been rigorously studied. ABNL-MARRO (A Basket study of Novel therapy for untreated MDS/MPN and Relapsed/Refractory Overlap Syndromes) is an international cooperation that leverages the expertise of the MDS/MPN International Working Group (IWG) and provides the framework for collaborative studies to advance treatment of MDS/MPN and to explore clinical and pathologic markers of disease severity, prognosis, and treatment response. ABNL MARRO 001 (AM-001) is an open label, randomly allocated phase 1/2 study that will test novel treatment combinations in MDS/MPNs, beginning with the novel targeted agent itacitinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor, combined with ASTX727, a fixed dose oral combination of the DNMTi decitabine and the cytidine deaminase inhibitor cedazuridine to improve decitabine bioavailability. Beyond the primary objectives of the study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel treatment combinations in MDS/MPN, the study will (i) Establish the ABNL MARRO infrastructure for future prospective studies, (ii) Forge innovative scientific research that will improve our understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms of disease, and (iii) Inform the clinical application of diagnostic criteria, risk stratification and prognostication tools, as well as response assessments in this heterogeneous patient population.

    "abstract": "Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder with overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Median overall survival of this aggressive myeloid malignancy is only 2-3 years, with a 15-30% risk of acute leukemic transformation. The paucity of clinical trials specifically designed for CMML has made therapeutic management of CMML patients challenging. As a result, treatment paradigms for CMML patients are largely borrowed from MDS and MPN. The standard of care still relies on hydroxyurea, hypomethylating agents (HMA), and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, this latter option remaining the only potentially curative therapy. To date, approved drugs for CMML treatment are HMA, including azacitidine, decitabine, and more recently the oral combination of decitabine and cedazuridine. However, HMA treatment does not meaningfully alter the natural course of this disease. New treatment approaches for improving CMML-associated cytopenias or targeting the CMML malignant clone are emerging. More than 25 therapeutic agents are currently being evaluated in phase 1 or phase 2 clinical trials for CMML and other myeloid malignancies, often in combination with a HMA backbone. Several novel agents, such as sotatercept, ruxolitinib, lenzilumab, and tagraxofusp have shown promising clinical efficacy in CMML. Current evidence supports the idea that effective treatment in CMML will likely require combination therapy targeting multiple pathways, which emphasizes the need for additional new therapeutic options. This review focuses on recent therapeutic advances and innovative treatment strategies in CMML, including global and molecularly targeted approaches.

Preclinical work demonstrated a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile approximate to parenteral decitabine, leading to early-phase clinical trials of oral cedazuridine-decitabine (C-DEC) in myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). A combination of oral decitabine 35 mg with oral cedazuridine 100 mg was established as the recommended phase 2 dose.

Complex disease biology has posed significant challenge to the development of novel therapeutics. Despite myriad clinical trials, none have been superior to azacitidine and decitabine (DEC) therapy. These therapies present a substantial burden for patients with 5 and 7\u00a0days of parenteral treatment in an infusion clinic. To overcome this limitation, a fixed drug combination of oral DEC-cedazuridine (C-DEC), a cytidine deaminase inhibitor with documented safety profile was developed. This drug was recently approved by the US FDA, Australian TGA and Health Canada for newly diagnosed or previously treated intermediate or high risk by international prognostic scoring system, MDS and CMML.

All available cohort studies of patients with CMML treated with decitabine and azacitidine were identified. The primary endpoints of this meta-analysis were response to hypomethylating agents. Pooled estimates of treatment response and drug-related adverse events were calculated using fixed or random effect models. Fourteen studies with 600 CMML patients (decitabine: n=196; azacitidine: n=404) were identified and included for meta-analysis. HMAs yielded a pooled ORR estimate of 43% (95% CI: 36%-50%) in patients with CMML. Patients received either azacitidine or decitabine exhibited comparable incidence of ORR (43% vs. 45%, P=0.810), while significantly higher incidence of mCR was observed in patients treated with decitabine (23% vs. 10%, P=0.000). Decitabine treatment was also associated with higher incidence of transfusion independence (42% vs. 20%, P=0.044). Both HMAs led to objective hematologic or non-hematologic AEs (27%-43%), while dosage modification/delay were more frequent in patients treated with azacitidine (81% vs. 67%, P=0.021). This current study may provide preliminary data in evaluating the efficacy and safety of HMAs in patients with CMML. Decitabine and azacitidine are comparable effective and safe in treating CMML.

We aimed to investigate whether hypomethylating agents provide a benefit in subgroups of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia compared with other treatments. For this retrospective cohort study, data were retrieved between Nov 30, 2017, and Jan 5, 2019, from 38 centres in the USA and Europe. We included non-selected, consecutive patients diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, who received chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia-directed therapy. Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia according to 2016 WHO criteria at initial diagnosis (ie, \u226520% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood) or with unavailability of treatment data were excluded. Outcomes assessed included overall survival, time to next treatment, and time to transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia. Analyses were adjusted by age, sex, platelet count, and Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia-Specific Prognostic Scoring System (CPSS). Patients were grouped by first received treatment with either hydroxyurea, hypomethylating agents, or intensive chemotherapy, and stratified by risk according to blast count, French-American-British subtype, CPSS, WHO 2016 subtype, and the eligibility criteria of the DACOTA trial (NCT02214407). 949 patients diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia between April 13, 1981, and Oct 26, 2018, were included. Median follow-up was 23\u00b74 months (IQR 11\u00b75-42\u00b73) from diagnosis and 16\u00b72 months (6\u00b76-31\u00b76) from start of first-line treatment. 412 (43%) of 949 patients received hypomethylating agents as first treatment, 391 (41%) hydroxyurea, and 83 (9%) intensive chemotherapy.

In patients with myeloproliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (myeloproliferative CMML), median overall survival was 12\u00b76 months (10\u00b77-15\u00b70) versus 17\u00b76 months (14\u00b78-21\u00b75; HR 1\u00b738 [1\u00b712-1\u00b770]; p=0\u00b70027) for patients treated with hydroxyurea versus hypomethylating agents, and 12\u00b73 months (8\u00b74-16\u00b76) versus 17\u00b76 months (14\u00b78-21\u00b75; HR 1\u00b744 [1\u00b702-2\u00b703]; p=0\u00b7040) for intensive chemotherapy versus hypomethylating agents. Hypomethylating agents did not confer an overall survival advantage for patients classified as having lower-risk disease (ie, myelodysplastic chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia with <10% blasts, CMML-0, or lower-risk CPSS). These data suggest hypomethylating agents as the preferred therapy for patients with higher-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and those with myeloproliferative CMML. Our findings also suggest that CPSS is a valuable tool to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from hypomethylating agents. Further evidence from prospective cohorts would be desirable.

To support Asia-inclusive global development, we applied multiregional clinical trial (MRCT) principles of the International Conference on Harmonisation E17 guidelines by evaluating similarity in drug-related and disease-related intrinsic and extrinsic factors. A PubMed literature review (January 2000-November 2019) supported similarity in epidemiology of higher-risk MDS, AML, and CMML in Western and East Asian populations. Furthermore, the treatment of MDS/AML was similar in both East Asian and Western regions, with the same dose of azacitidine being the standard of care. Median overall survival in MDS following azacitidine treatment was generally comparable across regions, and the types and frequencies of molecular alterations in AML and MDS were comparable. Dose-escalation studies established the same maximum tolerated dose of pevonedistat in combination with azacitidine in Western and East Asian populations. Pevonedistat clearance was similar across races. Taken together, conservation of drug-related and disease-related intrinsic and extrinsic factors supported design of an Asia-inclusive Phase 3 trial and a pooled East Asian region. A sample size of ~\u00a030 East Asian patients (of ~\u00a0450 randomized) was estimated as needed to demonstrate consistency in efficacy relative to the global population. This analysis is presented as an exemplar to illustrate application of clinical pharmacology and translational science principles in designing Asia-inclusive MRCTs. Study Highlights WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? Azacitidine is the standard of care for myelodysplastic syndromes/low-blast acute myeloid leukemia (AML) across Western and East Asian patients. The first-in-class small-molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme, pevonedistat, has been investigated as a single agent in multiple studies of hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies and in combination with azacitidine in elderly patients with untreated AML. WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS? By applying clinical pharmacology and translational science and International Conference on Harmonisation E17 principles, this study designed an East Asian-inclusive global pivotal Phase 3 trial of pevonedistat, taking into consideration drug-related and disease-related intrinsic and extrinsic factors. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE? These analyses provide scientific rationale for Asia-inclusive globalization of the pivotal, Phase 3 PANTHER trial and for pooling clinical data across the East Asian region for assessing consistency in efficacy. HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE? We developed a framework to facilitate efficient global clinical development of investigational therapies for rare cancers and orphan diseases in Asia-inclusive multiregional clinical trials.",

Using lentiviral expression of MN1 for oncogenic supplementation and transplanting transduced primary mononuclear CMML cells into immunocompromised mice, we established three serially transplantable CMML-PDX models with disease-related gene mutations that recapitulate the disease in vivo. Ectopic MN1 expression was confirmed to enhance the proliferation of CMML cells, which otherwise did not engraft upon secondary transplantation. Furthermore, MN1-supplemented CMML cells were serially transplantable into recipient mice up to 5 generations. This robust engraftment enabled an in vivo RNA interference screening targeting CMML-related mutated genes including NRAS, confirming that their functional relevance is preserved in the presence of MN1. The novel combination treatment with azacitidine and the MEK-inhibitor trametinib additively inhibited ERK-phosphorylation and thus depleted the signal from mutated NRAS. The combination treatment significantly prolonged survival of CMML mice compared to single-agent treatment. Thus, we identified the combination of azacitidine and trametinib as an effective treatment in NRAS-mutated CMML and propose its clinical development.",

    "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are characterised by abnormal epigenetic repression and differentiation of bone marrow haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Drugs that reverse epigenetic repression, such as 5-azacytidine (5-AZA), induce haematological improvement in half of treated patients. Although the mechanisms underlying therapy success are not yet clear, induction of endogenous retroelements (EREs) has been hypothesised. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we compared the transcription of EREs in bone marrow HSCs from a new cohort of MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) patients before and after 5-AZA treatment with HSCs from healthy donors and AML patients. We further examined ERE transcription using the most comprehensive annotation of ERE-overlapping transcripts expressed in HSCs, generated here by de novo transcript assembly and supported by full-length RNA-seq. Consistent with prior reports, we found that treatment with 5-AZA increased the representation of ERE-derived RNA-seq reads in the transcriptome. However, such increases were comparable between treatment responses and failures. The extended view of HSC transcriptional diversity offered by de novo transcript assembly argued against 5-AZA-responsive EREs as determinants of the outcome of therapy. Instead, it uncovered pre-treatment expression and alternative splicing of developmentally regulated gene transcripts as predictors of the response of MDS and CMML patients to 5-AZA treatment. Our study identifies the developmentally regulated transcriptional signatures of protein-coding and non-coding genes, rather than EREs, as correlates of a favourable response of MDS and CMML patients to 5-AZA treatment and offers novel candidates for further evaluation.",

Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), 30 myeloid leukemia-associated genes were analyzed in 15 MDS/CMML patients with excellent response to Aza.

Various myeloid cell lines and a healthy cohort were screened for methylation levels in 23 genes. Selected targets were verified on the MDS/CMML cohort. The study presented here showed a stable variant allele frequency and stable global methylation levels in responding patients.

Progression after HMA response was associated with a median overall-survival (OS) of 8 months, while median OS in patients with primary HMA failure was 4 months. Lower serum LDH levels (<250 Units/L) were associated with HMA responses by both criteria; while ASXL1 and TET2 mutational status had no impact. HMA treated patients had a longer median OS (31 vs 18\u2009months; P = .01), in comparison to those treated with conventional care regimens (excluding observation only patients), without any differences between AZA vs DAC (P = .37). In conclusion, this study highlights the inadequacies of HMA therapy in CMML, retrospectively validates the IWG MDS/MPN response criteria and underscores the need for newer, rationally derived therapies.",

The normal counterparts of BPDCN tumor cells are progenitors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, whereas the origins are thought to be hematopoietic stem cells. Approximately 10%-20% of BPDCN patients develop other hematologic malignancies, including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Mutations in epigenetic regulators are frequently observed in both BPDCN and CMML tumors. Azacitidine, a drug that targets epigenetic dysregulation, is known to be an effective treatment for CMML. However, it has been used in few BPDCN patients. Here, we report a BPDCN patient with skin lesions, bone marrow infiltration, and lymphadenopathy. CMML also developed during the course of BPDCN. Azacitidine had positive effects on CMML; however, BPDCN aggressively relapsed during treatment. Two TET2 mutations were found in both BPDCN and CMML tumors; one of which was commonly identified in both tumors.",
