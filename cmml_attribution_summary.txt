   Key Findings: In the CMML cohort, the overall response rate was 75%, with 12.5% achieving complete remission (CR) and 62.5% achieving morphologic CR with or without hematologic improvement (mCR with or without HI).
   Patient Population: Patients with MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) after failure of hypomethylating agents. 7 of 8 patients (87%) were high or very high risk by the IPSS-R.
   Treatment: Azacitidine 75 mg/m², venetoclax, and pevonedistat; specific dosing and schedule for venetoclax and pevonedistat not detailed in provided abstract.

   Key Findings: Hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine have overall response rates of ~40%-50% and complete remission rates of ~7%-17% in CMML patients.  Allogeneic stem cell transplant is the only potentially curative option, but has significant morbidity and mortality.
   Patient Population: Patients with Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML)
   Treatment: Hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine.  Allogeneic stem cell transplant is mentioned as a potentially curative option.

   Key Findings: CMML is the most frequent MDS/MPN overlap neoplasm, with a median overall survival of <36 months.  Adverse prognostic factors include increasing age, high WBC, circulating immature myeloid cells, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and truncating ASXL1 mutations. Hypomethylating agents (azacitidine, decitabine, oral decitabine/cedazuridine) have overall response rates of 40-50% and complete remission rates of <20%.
   Patient Population: CMML patients, primarily presenting in the 7th decade of life with male preponderance.
   Treatment: Hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine, decitabine and oral decitabine/cedazuridine are FDA approved for CMML.

   Key Findings: Azacitidine showed a trend towards improved two-year survival (62% vs 41% with best supportive care, p=0.067) and longer overall survival when used as first-line therapy compared to hydroxyurea (p=0.072, median OS 27.7 vs 6.2 months). Overall response rate was 70% (including 22% complete responses) according to IWG criteria. Monocyte count and cytogenetics negatively impacted survival.
   Patient Population: 48 CMML patients treated with azacitidine.  The study used matched-pair analyses comparing azacitidine to best supportive care and azacitidine first-line to hydroxyurea first-line.

   Key Findings: Current treatment for CMML remains unsatisfactory. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is the only curative option but is applicable to a minority of patients. Higher-risk patients with MDS-like characteristics are treated with HMAs, while those with myeloproliferative features receive hydroxyurea or HMAs; however, neither substantially modifies CMML's natural history.  Somatic mutations impact survival but don't predict response to current drugs.  Incorporating somatic mutations into prognostic scoring systems improves outcome prediction.
   Patient Population: Patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), categorized by risk (higher-risk with MDS-like characteristics, those with myeloproliferative features).
   Treatment: Higher-risk patients displaying MDS-like characteristics are treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs). Those with myeloproliferative features generally receive hydroxyurea or HMAs.

   Key Findings: Median survival for CMML patients is approximately 2 years. Hydroxyurea is the treatment of choice when the proliferative phase prevails. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation should be considered for younger, high-risk patients.  Combination AML-type therapy followed by autologous stem cell or marrow transplant is an alternative if a donor is unavailable.
   Patient Population: Patients with CMML; median age 70 years;  high-risk patients considered for transplantation.
   Treatment: Hydroxyurea for patients in the proliferative phase; allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for younger high-risk patients; combination AML-type therapy followed by autologous stem cell or marrow transplant if a donor is unavailable.

   Key Findings: Hypomethylating agents, the mainstay of therapy for CMML, induce complete remissions in less than 20% of patients and do not prolong survival compared to hydroxyurea. Allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) is potentially curative but few patients qualify due to advanced age and/or comorbidities.
   Patient Population: Patients with Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML), mostly older individuals.
   Treatment: Hypomethylating agents and hydroxyurea are mentioned as treatments.  Specific details on dosing and schedules are not provided.

   Key Findings: Median survival for CMML is 3 years (36 months).  20-30% of patients die from progression to AML. ASXL1 mutation predicts outcome.
   Patient Population: Patients with CMML, diagnosed after age 50, with male predominance.  The abstract mentions CMML-1 and CMML-2 distinctions based on blast cell percentage.
   Treatment: Hydroxyurea is used in myeloproliferative forms of CMML. Demethylating agents may be efficient in more aggressive forms.
