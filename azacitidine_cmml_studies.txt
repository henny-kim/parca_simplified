BACKGROUND: Bexmarilimab blocks Clever-1 on macrophages to enhance antigen 
presentation and T cell activation. Because Clever-1 is expressed by myeloid 
leukaemia cells, bexmarilimab may combat leukaemia and influence the tumour 
microenvironment to augment the effectiveness of standard-of-care therapy in 
patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia. The aim of 
this study was to determine the safety of bexmarilimab in combination with 
standard-of-care treatment in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid 
leukaemia and to identify the recommended dose for expansion of bexmarilimab in 
combination with standard of care.
METHODS: The phase 1 dose-escalation part of this multicentre, single-arm, phase 
1/2 study was done at six centres in Finland and the USA. Patients aged 18 years 
or older (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less) 
with myelodysplastic syndrome (2016 WHO) with a Revised International Prognostic 
Scoring System (IPPS-R) score of 3·5 or more for USA (3·0 for the European 
Union), chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (2016 WHO) with 10-19% marrow blasts, 
myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia with no response to 
or disease progression during hypomethylating agent treatment, or relapsed or 
refractory acute myeloid leukaemia were treated with escalating doses of 
bexmarilimab (1·0 mg/kg, 3·0 mg/kg, and 6·0 mg/kg, intravenous, once weekly, 
28-day cycle) in combination with azacitidine, administered as per label. Here 
we report the phase 1 part of the study, for which the primary outcome was 
safety (the incidence and frequency of dose limiting toxicities and the 
frequency and severity of adverse events) as well as the determination of the 
maximum tolerated dose and recommended expansion dose for the phase 2 part using 
a Bayesian optimal interval design. All patients receiving at least one dose of 
bexmarilimab were included in safety analyses, and those with a post-baseline 
activity assessment were included in activity analyses. This trial is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05428969) and EudraCT (2021-002104-12) databases. 
Phase 2 of the study is ongoing in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome with 
no response to hypomethylating agent.
FINDINGS: Between June 2, 2022, and Dec 7, 2023, 33 patients (14 with 
myelodysplastic syndrome, 19 with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid 
leukaemia) were enrolled in phase 1; no patients with chronic myelomonocytic 
leukaemia were identified. 19 (58%) patients were male and 14 (42%) were female, 
and 24 (73%) patients were non-Hispanic ethnicity, and eight (24%) were White. 
Median follow-up time for all patients was 6·2 months (IQR 3·5-10·7). The 
maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and the recommended expansion dose for 
phase 2 was established as 6·0 mg/kg in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome 
with no response to hypomethylating agents. There were no dose-limiting 
toxicities. The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were 
febrile neutropenia (n=8 [24%]), anemia (n=7 [21%]), and thrombocytopenia (n=5 
[15%]). Treatment-emergent deaths occurred as a result of sepsis (n=1 [3%]), 
neutropenic infection (n=1 [3%]), and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (n=1 
[3%]). Four patients presented treatment-related serious adverse events, one 
patient in the 1·0 mg/kg group, two in the 3·0 mg/kg group and one in the 6·0 
mg/kg group. These included rash (grade 3), capillary leak syndrome (grade 3), 
cryptogenic organising pneumonia (grade 3) and haemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (grade 5) which led to one death. The objective response 
rate was 45% (15 of 33; 95% CI 28-62) across all doses.
INTERPRETATION: Bexmarilimab in combination with azacitidine has a manageable 
safety profile, consistent with azacitidine, and shows promising clinical 
activity in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: Therapies for patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes 
(HR-MDS) who have failed hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are needed. This Phase 
I/II study evaluates the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of venetoclax, an 
orally bioavailable BCL-2 inhibitor, in combination with azacitidine in this 
population.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center, dose-escalation, Phase I/II trial 
(NCT04550442) involving 33 patients with HR-MDS or CMML (IPSS ≥ 1.5) who had 
progressed after prior HMA therapy. Patients received intravenous or 
subcutaneous azacitidine (SC) (75 mg/m² for 5 days) and venetoclax (100-400 mg 
for 7-14 days in a 28-day cycle). The primary endpoints were safety/tolerability 
(Phase 1) and overall response rate (ORR) (Phase 2).
RESULTS: Patients received a median of 3 cycles (range, 1-22). The maximum 
tolerated dose of venetoclax was 400 mg. Common grade 3-4 adverse events 
included neutropenia (19 %) and thrombocytopenia (10 %). The 4-week early 
mortality rate was 9 %. The ORR was 49 %, and the median overall survival (OS) 
was 7 months (95 % CI, 3.5-10.5). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 
6 months (95 % CI, 3.0-9.0). Four patients (12 %) underwent stem cell 
transplantation, with 3 of 4 alive at last follow-up (75 %).
CONCLUSION: Combining venetoclax with azacitidine is feasible for HR-MDS and 
CMML patients who failed prior HMA therapy. However, this combination did not 
significantly improve clinical outcomes in this patient population.

This phase 2 study investigated pevonedistat + azacitidine + venetoclax (n = 83) 
versus azacitidine + venetoclax (n = 81) in patients with newly diagnosed acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. The study was 
stopped early following negative results from PANTHER, which evaluated 
pevonedistat in higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes/chronic myelomonocytic 
leukemia or low-blast AML. Outcomes were analyzed up to the datacut. For 
pevonedistat + azacitidine + venetoclax versus azacitidine + venetoclax, the 
median follow-up was 8.44 versus 7.95 months; the complete remission (CR) rate 
was 45% versus 49%; composite CR (CCR; CR+CR with incomplete blood count 
recovery) was 77% versus 72%. There were no differences in event-free survival 
(primary endpoint; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.61-1.60; p = 0.477) or overall survival (HR: 1.42; 95% CI: 0.82-2.49; 
p = 0.896). In exploratory analyses in IDH-mutated AML, CCR rates were higher 
with pevonedistat + azacitidine + venetoclax versus azacitidine + venetoclax. 
Safety was similar between treatment arms. Efficacy/safety with 
azacitidine + venetoclax was consistent with the phase 3 VIALE-A study.

BACKGROUND: Hypomethylating agents are approved in higher-riskmyelodysplastic 
syndromes. The combination of a hypomethylating agent with venetoclax is 
standard of care in acute myeloid leukaemia. We investigated the safety and 
activity of the first totally oral combination of decitabine plus cedazuridine 
and venetoclax in patients with higher-risk-myelodysplastic syndromes and 
chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia.
METHODS: We did a single-centre, dose-escalation and dose-expansion, phase 1/2, 
clinical trial. Patients with treatment-naive higher-risk-myelodysplastic 
syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (risk level categorised as 
intermediate-2 or higher by the International Prognostic Scoring System) with 
excess blasts (>5%). Treatment consisted of oral decitabine 35 mg plus 
cedazuridine 100 mg on days 1-5 and venetoclax (variable doses of 100-400 mg, 
day 1 to 14, 28-day cycle). The primary outcomes were safety for the phase 1 
part and the overall response for the phase 2 part of the study. The trial is 
ongoing and this analysis was not prespecified. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04655755, and is currently enrolling participants.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 21, 2021, and Jan 20, 2023, we enrolled 39 patients (nine 
in phase 1 and 30 in phase 2). The median age was 71 years (range 27-94), 28 
(72%) patients were male, and 11 (28%) were female. The maximum tolerated dose 
was not reached, and the recommended phase 2 dose was established as oral 
decitabine 35 mg plus cedazuridine 100 mg for 5 days and venetoclax (400 mg) for 
14 days. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (33 
[85%] of 39), neutropenia (29 [74%]), and febrile neutropenia (eight [21%]). 
Four non-treatment-related deaths occurred on the study drugs due to sepsis 
(n=2), lung infection (n=1), and undetermined cause (n=1). The median follow-up 
time was 10·8 months (IQR 5·6-16·4). The overall response rate was 95% (95% CI 
83-99; 37/39). 19 (49%) patients proceeded to hematopoietic stem-cell 
transplantation.
INTERPRETATION: This early analysis suggests that the combination of oral 
decitabine plus cedazuridine with venetoclax for higher-risk-myelodysplastic 
syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia is safe in most patients, with 
encouraging activity. Longer follow-up will be needed to confirm these data.

Recent developments in high-risk Myelodysplastic Neoplasms (HR MDS) treatment 
are confronted with challenges in study design due to evolving drug combinations 
with Hypomethylating Agents (HMAs). The shift from the International Prognostic 
Scoring System (IPSS) to its molecular revision (IPSS-M) has notably influenced 
research and clinical practice. Introducing concepts like the MDS/AML overlap 
complicate classifications and including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) 
in MDS studies introduces another layer of complexity. The International 
Consortium for MDS emphasizes aligning HR MDS criteria with the 2022 ELN 
criteria for AML. Differences in advancements between AML and MDS treatments and 
hematological toxicity in HR MDS underline the importance of detailed trial 
designs. Effective therapeutic strategies require accurate reporting of adverse 
events, highlighting the need for clarity in criteria like the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). We provide an overview on 
negative clinical trials in HR MDS, analyze possible reasons and explore 
possibilities to optimize future clinical trials in this challenging patient 
population.
