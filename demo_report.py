## Usage Instructions

To generate a report for any medicine, run:
```bash
python medicine_clinical_extractor.py <medicine_name>
```

Available medicines: azacitidine, decitabine, hydroxyurea

Example:
```bash
python medicine_clinical_extractor.py azacitidine
python medicine_clinical_extractor.py decitabine
python medicine_clinical_extractor.py hydroxyurea
```

The script will:
1. Search PubMed for relevant studies
2. Extract clinical data using AI-like pattern matching
3. Generate a structured report with citations
4. Save both markdown report and JSON data files
