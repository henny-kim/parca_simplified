Patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic 
myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) unfit for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
have poor outcomes. Novel therapies that provide durable benefit with favorable 
tolerability and clinically meaningful improvement in survival are needed. 
T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3) is an immuno-myeloid 
regulator expressed on immune and leukemic stem cells in myeloid malignancies. 
Sabatolimab is a novel immunotherapy targeting TIM-3 with a potential dual 
mechanism of reactivating the immune system and directly targeting TIM-3+ 
leukemic blasts suppressing the growth of cancer cells. Here, we describe the 
aims and design of the phase III STIMULUS-MDS2 trial, which aims to demonstrate 
the potential for sabatolimab plus azacitidine to improve survival for patients 
with higher-risk MDS and CMML-2 (NCT04266301). Clinical Trial Registration: 
NCT04266301 (ClinicalTrials.gov).

BACKGROUND: Myeloid neoplasms (myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS], myelofibrosis, 
and chronic myelomonocytic [CMML]) are aggressive hematological malignancies for 
which, despite recent approvals, novel therapies are needed to improve clinical 
outcomes. The hedgehog (HH) pathway is one of the main pathways for cancer stem 
cells survival and several HH inhibitors (HHi) are approved in clinical 
practice.
METHODS: Sonidegib (SON), an oral HHi, was tested in this phase 1/1b trial in 
combination with azacitidine (AZA, 75 mg/m2 days ×7) in patients with newly 
diagnosed and relapsed/refractory (r/r) chronic MN or acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML).
RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (28 [45%] newly diagnosed) were treated in this 
study, including 10 patients in the dose-finding component and 52 patients in 
phase 1b. SON 200 mg oral daily on days 1-28 each cycle was deemed the 
recommended dose for phase 1b. Out of 21 rrAML patients, two achieved response 
(one complete response/one morphologic leukemia-free state) with no responses 
seen in seven r/r MDS/CMML patients. In newly diagnosed AML/MDS, response was 
seen in six (three had complete remission, two had morphological leukemia-free 
status) of 27 patients. Median overall survival was 26.4 and 4.7 months for 
newly diagnosed MDS and AML, respectively. Safety was satisfactory with common 
(>20%) side effects including fatigue, constipation, nausea, cough, insomnia, 
and diarrhea. Only 7% of patients died in the study, and none of the deaths were 
deemed related to treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that AZA + SON are a safe combination in a patient 
with MN. Similar to other hedgehog inhibitors, this combination yielded limited 
response rate in patients with myeloid neoplasms.

PURPOSE: Hydroxyurea (HY) is a reference treatment of advanced 
myeloproliferative neoplasms. We conducted a randomized phase III trial 
comparing decitabine (DAC) and HY in advanced myeloproliferative chronic 
myelomonocytic leukemias (CMML).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed myeloproliferative CMML patients with 
advanced disease were randomly assigned 1:1 to intravenous DAC (20 mg/m2/d days 
1-5) or HY (1-4 g/d) in 28-day cycles. The primary end point was event-free 
survival (EFS), events being death and acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML) 
transformation or progression.
RESULTS: One-hundred seventy patients received DAC (n = 84) or HY (n = 86). 
Median age was 72 and 74 years, and median WBC count 32.5 × 109/L and 31.2 × 
109/L in the DAC and HY arms, respectively. Thirty-three percent of DAC and 31% 
of HY patients had CMML-2. Patients received a median of five DAC and six HY 
cycles. With a median follow-up of 17.5 months, median EFS was 12.1 months in 
the DAC arm and 10.3 months in the HY arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.59 
to 1.16; P = .27). There was no significant interaction between treatment effect 
and blast or platelet count, anemia, CMML Prognostic Scoring System, Groupe 
Francophone des Myelodysplasies, or CMML Prognostic Scoring System-mol risk. 
Fifty-three (63%) DAC patients achieved a response compared with 30 (35%) HY 
patients (P = .0004). Median duration of response was similar in both arms (DAC, 
16.3 months; HY, 17.4 months; P = .90). Median overall survival was 18.4 months 
in the DAC arm and 21.9 months in the HY arm (P = .67). Compared with HY, DAC 
significantly reduced the risk of CMML progression or transformation to acute 
myelomonocytic leukemia (cause-specific HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.94; P = 
.005) at the expense of death without progression or transformation 
(cause-specific HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 0.82 to 2.9; P = .04).
CONCLUSION: Compared with HY, frontline treatment with DAC did not improve EFS 
in patients with advanced myeloproliferative CMML (ClinicalTrials.gov 
identifier: NCT02214407).
