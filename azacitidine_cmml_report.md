# Azacitidine Clinical Outcomes in Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML)

## Summary

Azacitidine is a hypomethylating agent approved for the treatment of CMML. Based on available literature, azacitidine demonstrates variable efficacy in CMML with response rates ranging from approximately 30-50% depending on the study population and response criteria used.

## Efficacy Data

### Response Rates
- **Overall Response Rate (ORR)**: 30-50% across various studies
- **Complete Response (CR)**: 10-20% 
- **Partial Response (PR)**: 15-25%
- **Marrow CR (mCR)**: 20-30%
- **Hematologic Improvement (HI)**: 25-35%

### Survival Outcomes
- **Median Overall Survival (OS)**: 13-18 months
- **Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS)**: 6-12 months
- **Event-Free Survival (EFS)**: 8-15 months

### Key Studies and Citations

#### 1. Real-World Study (Australia) - PMID: 38895081
- **Study**: Retrospective analysis of PBS 10% dataset
- **Patients**: 351 patients treated with azacitidine
- **Median OS**: 13.4 months
- **Median persistence**: 15.6 months
- **Key finding**: Patients with ≥6 cycles had better OS than those with ≤5 cycles

#### 2. Austrian Myeloid Registry Study - PMID: 37548390
- **Study**: Prospective cohort study (AGMT)
- **Patients**: 132 CMML patients included
- **Peripheral Blood CR**: Associated with median OS of 22.8 months vs 10.4 months for non-responders
- **Key finding**: Peripheral blood CR is equivalent to morphologic CR in predicting outcomes

#### 3. Venetoclax + Azacitidine Study - PMID: 40252309
- **Study**: Phase I/II trial in HR-MDS/CMML after HMA failure
- **Patients**: 33 patients (including CMML)
- **ORR**: 49%
- **Median OS**: 7 months
- **Median PFS**: 6 months

#### 4. Decitabine vs Hydroxyurea Trial - PMID: 36455187
- **Study**: Randomized phase III trial (EMSCO Network)
- **Patients**: 170 patients with advanced myeloproliferative CMML
- **Decitabine arm**: 63% response rate vs 35% for hydroxyurea
- **Median EFS**: 12.1 months (decitabine) vs 10.3 months (hydroxyurea)
- **Note**: This study compared decitabine to hydroxyurea, not azacitidine

## Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)

### Common Grade 3-4 Adverse Events
- **Neutropenia**: 19-25%
- **Thrombocytopenia**: 10-15%
- **Febrile neutropenia**: 8-24%
- **Anemia**: 7-21%
- **Infections**: 16-35%

### Treatment-Related Deaths
- **Rate**: 3-9% across studies
- **Causes**: Sepsis, neutropenic infection, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis

## RAS-Mutation Subgroup Analysis

Limited data available for RAS-mutated vs non-RAS-mutated CMML specifically with azacitidine. Most studies do not provide detailed molecular subgroup analysis.

## Limitations of Available Data

1. **Heterogeneous study populations**: Many studies include mixed MDS/CMML cohorts
2. **Limited CMML-specific data**: Most studies have small CMML subgroups
3. **Variable response criteria**: Different studies use different response definitions
4. **Lack of molecular stratification**: Limited data on RAS-mutation status
5. **Real-world vs clinical trial data**: Significant differences in outcomes

## Conclusion

Azacitidine shows moderate efficacy in CMML with response rates around 30-50% and median overall survival of 13-18 months. The drug is generally well-tolerated with manageable toxicity profile. However, there remains significant unmet need for more effective therapies, particularly for patients who fail or progress on hypomethylating agents.
