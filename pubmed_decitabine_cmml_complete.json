The combination of hypomethylating agents with venetoclax (Ven) has demonstrated promising results in these diseases, although randomized clinical trials are needed for validation. In this retrospective study, we compared two matched cohorts of patients with MDS or CMML: one receiving oral decitabine-cedazuridine (DEC-C, n\u2009=\u200973) and one receiving DEC-C and Ven (DEC-C-Ven, n\u2009=\u200951), in three contemporary clinical trials.

      "abstract": "Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by peripheral blood monocytosis and bone marrow dysplasia. In approximately one-fourth of cases, CMML can demonstrate progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), referred to as AML ex CMML. We present a 58-year-old woman with a past medical history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who demonstrated 24% bone marrow blasts on a repeat biopsy obtained two years after being diagnosed with CMML.

The combination of a hypomethylating agent with venetoclax is standard of care in acute myeloid leukaemia. We investigated the safety and activity of the first totally oral combination of decitabine plus cedazuridine and venetoclax in patients with higher-risk-myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. We did a single-centre, dose-escalation and dose-expansion, phase 1/2, clinical trial. Patients with treatment-naive higher-risk-myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (risk level categorised as intermediate-2 or higher by the International Prognostic Scoring System) with excess blasts (>5%). Treatment consisted of oral decitabine 35 mg plus cedazuridine 100 mg on days 1-5 and venetoclax (variable doses of 100-400 mg, day 1 to 14, 28-day cycle). The primary outcomes were safety for the phase 1 part and the overall response for the phase 2 part of the study. The trial is ongoing and this analysis was not prespecified. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04655755, and is currently enrolling participants. Between Jan 21, 2021, and Jan 20, 2023, we enrolled 39 patients (nine in phase 1 and 30 in phase 2). The median age was 71 years (range 27-94), 28 (72%) patients were male, and 11 (28%) were female. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and the recommended phase 2 dose was established as oral decitabine 35 mg plus cedazuridine 100 mg for 5 days and venetoclax (400 mg) for 14 days. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (33 [85%] of 39), neutropenia (29 [74%]), and febrile neutropenia (eight [21%]). Four non-treatment-related deaths occurred on the study drugs due to sepsis (n=2), lung infection (n=1), and undetermined cause (n=1).

The combination of a hypomethylating agent with venetoclax is standard of care in acute myeloid leukaemia. We investigated the safety and activity of the first totally oral combination of decitabine plus cedazuridine and venetoclax in patients with higher-risk-myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. We did a single-centre, dose-escalation and dose-expansion, phase 1/2, clinical trial. Patients with treatment-naive higher-risk-myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (risk level categorised as intermediate-2 or higher by the International Prognostic Scoring System) with excess blasts (>5%). Treatment consisted of oral decitabine 35 mg plus cedazuridine 100 mg on days 1-5 and venetoclax (variable doses of 100-400 mg, day 1 to 14, 28-day cycle). The primary outcomes were safety for the phase 1 part and the overall response for the phase 2 part of the study. The trial is ongoing and this analysis was not prespecified. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04655755, and is currently enrolling participants. Between Jan 21, 2021, and Jan 20, 2023, we enrolled 39 patients (nine in phase 1 and 30 in phase 2). The median age was 71 years (range 27-94), 28 (72%) patients were male, and 11 (28%) were female. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and the recommended phase 2 dose was established as oral decitabine 35 mg plus cedazuridine 100 mg for 5 days and venetoclax (400 mg) for 14 days. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (33 [85%] of 39), neutropenia (29 [74%]), and febrile neutropenia (eight [21%]). Four non-treatment-related deaths occurred on the study drugs due to sepsis (n=2), lung infection (n=1), and undetermined cause (n=1). The median follow-up time was 10\u00b78 months (IQR 5\u00b76-16\u00b74).

      "abstract": "Objective Azacitidine (AZA) has been the standard of care for elderly patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, reliable clinical predictors of outcome have yet to be identified. The prognostic value of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels has been reported for decitabine therapy. We evaluated pretreatment HbF levels in AZA monotherapy as a prognostic marker in MDS/acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods This study included chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients who had received seven-day treatment schedules of AZA and whose HbF levels were measured at the onset of treatment between March 2011 and July 2020. Patients were grouped into HbF-normal (<1.0%) or HbF-elevated (\u22651.0%) groups. Responses were classified according to the International Working Group 2006 criteria. Patients Twenty-nine patients were included and classified as having either MDS (n=21), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n=5), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm unclassifiable (n=1), or AML with <30% marrow blasts (n=2) based on the World Health Organization 2016 diagnostic criteria. According to the revised International Prognostic Scoring System classification, 20/29 patients were at intermediate, high, or very high risk. Pretreatment HbF levels were elevated in 13/29 patients. Results The median follow-up duration was 13.0 (range 1.5-93.5) months. The HbF-elevated group was associated with a significantly higher hematologic improvement rate (76.9% vs. 25%, p=0.009) and better overall survival (median, 21.0 vs. 13.0 months, p=0.048) than the HbF-normal group. Conclusion These results suggest that elevated pretreatment HbF levels can predict better outcomes in patients with MDS/AML treated with AZA.",

      "key_findings": "Objective Azacitidine (AZA) has been the standard of care for elderly patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, reliable clinical predictors of outcome have yet to be identified. The prognostic value of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels has been reported for decitabine therapy. We evaluated pretreatment HbF levels in AZA monotherapy as a prognostic marker in MDS/acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods This study included chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients who had received seven-day treatment schedules of AZA and whose HbF levels were measured at the onset of treatment between March 2011 and July 2020. Patients were grouped into HbF-normal (<1.0%) or HbF-elevated (\u22651.0%) groups. Responses were classified according to the International Working Group 2006 criteria. Patients Twenty-nine patients were included and classified as having either MDS (n=21), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n=5), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm unclassifiable (n=1), or AML with <30% marrow blasts (n=2) based on the World Health Organization 2016 diagnostic criteria. According to the revised International Prognostic Scoring System classification, 20/29 patients were at intermediate, high, or very high risk. Pretreatment HbF levels were elevated in 13/29 patients. Results The median follow-up duration was 13.0 (range 1.5-93.5) months. The HbF-elevated group was associated with a significantly higher hematologic improvement rate (76.9% vs. 25%, p=0.009) and better overall survival (median, 21.0 vs. 13.0 months, p=0.048) than the HbF-normal group. Conclusion These results suggest that elevated pretreatment HbF levels can predict better outcomes in patients with MDS/AML treated with AZA.",

We report the case of a 63-year-old male who presented with a recurrent cough and gradually progressive dyspnea in the absence of fever. Based upon clinical symptoms, computed tomography findings, bone marrow aspiration, flow cytometry studies and cytogenetic analyses, the patient was diagnosed with PAP secondary to CMML. He underwent whole lung lavage in March 2016 to alleviate his dyspnea, after which he began combined chemotherapeutic treatment with decitabine and cytarabine. The patient died in January 2020 as a consequence of severe pulmonary infection.

      "key_findings": "Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare condition that can cause progressive symptoms including dyspnea, cough and respiratory insufficiency. Secondary PAP is generally associated with hematological malignancies including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of PAP occurring secondary to CMML. We report the case of a 63-year-old male who presented with a recurrent cough and gradually progressive dyspnea in the absence of fever. Based upon clinical symptoms, computed tomography findings, bone marrow aspiration, flow cytometry studies and cytogenetic analyses, the patient was diagnosed with PAP secondary to CMML. He underwent whole lung lavage in March 2016 to alleviate his dyspnea, after which he began combined chemotherapeutic treatment with decitabine and cytarabine. The patient died in January 2020 as a consequence of severe pulmonary infection. This case offers insight regarding the mechanistic basis for PAP secondary to CMML and highlights potential risk factors.",

Pharmacodynamic studies have suggested superiority of the longer 10-day regimen of decitabine that has shown promising results in patients with high-risk AML in phase 2 trials. We hypothesised that venetoclax with 10-day decitabine could have improved activity in patients with newly diagnosed AML and those with relapsed or refractory AML, particularly in high-risk subgroups. This single centre, phase 2 trial was done at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). The study enrolled older patients (aged >60 years) with newly diagnosed AML, not eligible for intensive chemotherapy; secondary AML (progressed after myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia); and relapsed or refractory AML.

The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included infections with grades 3 or 4 neutropenia (n=79, 47%) and febrile neutropenia (n=49, 29%). 139 (83%) of 168 patients had serious adverse events, most frequently neutropenic fever (n=63, 38%), followed by pneumonia (n=17, 10%) and sepsis (n=16, 10%). The 30-day mortality for all patients was 3\u00b76% (n=6, 95% CI 1\u00b77-7\u00b78).

The median duration of response was not reached (95% CI 9\u00b70-not reached) in newly diagnosed AML, 5\u00b71 months (95% CI 0\u00b79-not reached) in untreated secondary AML, not reached (95% CI 2\u00b75-not reached) in previously treated secondary AML, and 16\u00b78 months (95% CI 6\u00b76-not reached) in relapsed or refractory AML. Venetoclax with 10-day decitabine has a manageable safety profile and showed high activity in newly diagnosed AML and molecularly defined subsets of relapsed or refractory AML.

More effective hypomethylating agents are needed for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. In the present study, we aimed to compare the activity and safety of two doses of guadecitabine in hypomethylating agent treatment-naive or relapsed or refractory patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. This phase 2 part of the phase 1/2, randomised, open-label study enrolled patients aged 18 years or older from 14 North American medical centres with International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-1-risk, intermediate-2-risk, or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. They were either hypomethylating agent treatment-naive or had relapsed or refractory disease after previous hypomethylating agent treatment as determined by the investigators' judgment. Eligible patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer algorithm for dynamic randomisation to subcutaneous guadecitabine 60 or 90 mg/m Between July 9, 2012, and April 7, 2014, 105 patients were enrolled: 55 (52%) were allocated to guadecitabine 60 mg/m Guadecitabine was clinically active with acceptable tolerability in patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.

Treatment cycles lasted 28 days, with 5 days of drug administration. In cycle 1, each patient received a cohort-defined dose of oral decitabine on day -3, a 1-h intravenous infusion of decitabine 20 mg/m Between Oct 28, 2014, and Nov 13, 2015, we enrolled 44 eligible patients (of 75 screened) with previously treated or newly diagnosed myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia; 43 of the enrolled patients were evaluable. Participants were treated in five cohorts: cohorts 1-4 included six evaluable patients each; cohort 5 included 19 patients in a 13-patient expansion.

      "abstract": "Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is an aggressive myeloid neoplasm in which treatment strategies with the capacity to improve survival are currently lacking. Clinical features are heterogeneous and although the overall prognosis is poor, survival can vary significantly between individuals. This reflects the need for an individualized treatment approach which incorporates accurate risk stratification. Though numerous prognostic scores exist, newer CMML-specific models incorporating molecular data should be favored. While asymptomatic, low-risk patients should be observed until their disease progresses, the majority of patients will require treatment. Due to a deficiency in treatments with disease-modifying capacity, any patient who requires treatment should be considered for enrollment in clinical trials evaluating novel therapeutic approaches. Allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) remains the only current therapy with the potential to cure the disease and should be considered in most patients with intermediate- to high-risk disease. However, substantial risks are involved and, in part, because of advanced age at diagnosis, a minority of patients are candidates. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have become a preferred treatment approach, and should be used in those with cytopenias. Patients presenting with proliferative features can be treated with hydroxyurea to manage their symptoms and control leukocytosis, though HMAs can be incorporated as well, particularly in patients with higher risk disease. HMAs should also be considered in patients with a high burden of disease prior to proceeding with allo-SCT. Induction chemotherapy should be reserved for younger, healthy patients who have transformed to acute myeloid leukemia to induce remission prior to transplant. Supportive care utilizing transfusion support, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and infection prevention measures should be incorporated into the care of all patients.",

      "key_findings": "Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is an aggressive myeloid neoplasm in which treatment strategies with the capacity to improve survival are currently lacking. Clinical features are heterogeneous and although the overall prognosis is poor, survival can vary significantly between individuals. This reflects the need for an individualized treatment approach which incorporates accurate risk stratification. Though numerous prognostic scores exist, newer CMML-specific models incorporating molecular data should be favored. While asymptomatic, low-risk patients should be observed until their disease progresses, the majority of patients will require treatment. Due to a deficiency in treatments with disease-modifying capacity, any patient who requires treatment should be considered for enrollment in clinical trials evaluating novel therapeutic approaches. Allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) remains the only current therapy with the potential to cure the disease and should be considered in most patients with intermediate- to high-risk disease. However, substantial risks are involved and, in part, because of advanced age at diagnosis, a minority of patients are candidates. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have become a preferred treatment approach, and should be used in those with cytopenias. Patients presenting with proliferative features can be treated with hydroxyurea to manage their symptoms and control leukocytosis, though HMAs can be incorporated as well, particularly in patients with higher risk disease. HMAs should also be considered in patients with a high burden of disease prior to proceeding with allo-SCT. Induction chemotherapy should be reserved for younger, healthy patients who have transformed to acute myeloid leukemia to induce remission prior to transplant. Supportive care utilizing transfusion support, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and infection prevention measures should be incorporated into the care of all patients.",

      "abstract": "The present review will focus on the current management of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) as well as in future therapeutic perspectives. CMML is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by peripheral blood monocytosis and myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative alterations in the bone marrow. Clinical behavior of the disease can be heterogeneous, with some patients having an indolent form of the disease, whereas others experience an aggressive course with decreased survival and eventual transformation to leukemia. Multiple studies have helped define the clinical, cytogenetic and mutational prognostic features of the disease. In addition, several prognostic scoring systems have been developed for patients with CMML. Incorporation of mutation data, particularly presence of frameshift and nonsense ASXL1 mutations, into these models seems to be allowing to further improve our ability to predict patient outcomes. Prognosis of patients with CMML is heterogeneous. Incorporation of mutational data into current clinical prognostic models has allowed to improve our ability to predict patient outcomes. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only potentially curative treatment for patients with CMML but is only an option for a subset of patients. For this reason, hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine have become the backbone of current therapy for patients with CMML, but new therapeutic strategies are required to improve their outcomes.",

      "key_findings": "The present review will focus on the current management of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) as well as in future therapeutic perspectives. CMML is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by peripheral blood monocytosis and myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative alterations in the bone marrow. Clinical behavior of the disease can be heterogeneous, with some patients having an indolent form of the disease, whereas others experience an aggressive course with decreased survival and eventual transformation to leukemia. Multiple studies have helped define the clinical, cytogenetic and mutational prognostic features of the disease. In addition, several prognostic scoring systems have been developed for patients with CMML. Incorporation of mutation data, particularly presence of frameshift and nonsense ASXL1 mutations, into these models seems to be allowing to further improve our ability to predict patient outcomes. Prognosis of patients with CMML is heterogeneous. Incorporation of mutational data into current clinical prognostic models has allowed to improve our ability to predict patient outcomes. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only potentially curative treatment for patients with CMML but is only an option for a subset of patients. For this reason, hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine have become the backbone of current therapy for patients with CMML, but new therapeutic strategies are required to improve their outcomes.",

We compared the overall survival of patients receiving rigosertib and best supportive care with that of patients receiving best supportive care only in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes with excess blasts after failure of azacitidine or decitabine treatment. We did this randomised controlled trial at 74 hospitals and university medical centres in the USA and Europe. We enrolled patients with diagnosis of refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB)-1, RAEB-2, RAEB-t, or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia based on local site assessment, and treatment failure with a hypomethylating drug in the past 2 years. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive rigosertib 1800 mg per 24 h via 72-h continuous intravenous infusion administered every other week or best supportive care with or without low-dose cytarabine. Randomisation was stratified by pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01241500. From Dec 13, 2010, to Aug 15, 2013, we enrolled 299 patients: 199 assigned to rigosertib, 100 assigned to best supportive care. Median follow-up was 19\u00b75 months (IQR 11\u00b79-27\u00b73). As of Feb 1, 2014, median overall survival was 8\u00b72 months (95% CI 6\u00b71-10\u00b71) in the rigosertib group and 5\u00b79 months (4\u00b71-9\u00b73) in the best supportive care group (hazard ratio 0\u00b787, 95% CI 0\u00b767-1\u00b714; p=0\u00b733). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were anaemia (34 [18%] of 184 patients in the rigosertib group vs seven [8%] of 91 patients in the best supportive care group), thrombocytopenia (35 [19%] vs six [7%]), neutropenia (31 [17%] vs seven [8%]), febrile neutropenia (22 [12%] vs ten [11%]), and pneumonia (22 [12%] vs ten [11%]). 41 (22%) of 184 patients in the rigosertib group and 30 (33%) of 91 patients in the best supportive care group died due to adverse events and three deaths were attributed to rigosertib treatment. Rigosertib did not significantly improve overall survival compared with best supportive care. A randomised phase 3 trial of rigosertib (NCT 02562443) is underway in specific subgroups of patients deemed to be at high risk, including patients with very high risk per the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System criteria.

By immunohistochemical analysis, PD-L1 protein expression was observed in MDS CD34+ cells, whereas stroma/non-blast cellular compartment was positive for PD-1. In a cohort of patients treated with epigenetic therapy, PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1 and CTLA4 expression was upregulated. Patients resistant to therapy had relative higher increments in gene expression compared with patients who achieved response. Treatment of leukemia cells with decitabine resulted in a dose-dependent upregulation of above genes. Exposure to decitabine resulted in partial demethylation of PD-1 in leukemia cell lines and human samples. This study suggests that PD-1 signaling may be involved in MDS pathogenesis and resistance mechanisms to hypomethylating agents. Blockade of this pathway can be a potential therapy in MDS and AML.",

In a cohort of patients treated with epigenetic therapy, PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1 and CTLA4 expression was upregulated. Patients resistant to therapy had relative higher increments in gene expression compared with patients who achieved response. Treatment of leukemia cells with decitabine resulted in a dose-dependent upregulation of above genes. Exposure to decitabine resulted in partial demethylation of PD-1 in leukemia cell lines and human samples. This study suggests that PD-1 signaling may be involved in MDS pathogenesis and resistance mechanisms to hypomethylating agents. Blockade of this pathway can be a potential therapy in MDS and AML.",

It is characterized by absolute monocytosis (>1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2079/L) in the peripheral blood that persists for at least 3 months. The diagnosis of CMML rests on a combination of morphologic, histopathologic and chromosomal abnormalities in the bone marrow. It is important to exclude other myeloproliferative neoplasms and infectious/autoimmune conditions that can cause monocytosis. Several CMML-specific prognostic models incorporating novel mutations have been recently reported. The Mayo prognostic model classified CMML patients into three risk groups based on: increased absolute monocyte count, presence of circulating blasts, hemoglobin <10 gm/dL and platelets <100\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2079/L. The median survival was 32 months, 18.5 months and 10 months in the low, intermediate, and high-risk groups, respectively. The Groupe Francophone des (GFM) score segregated CMML patients into three risk groups based on: age >65 years, WBC >15\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2079/L, anemia, platelets <100\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2079/L, and ASXL1 mutation status. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, survival ranged from not reached in the low-risk group to 14.4 months in the high-risk group. The Food and Drug Administration has approved azacitidine and decitabine for the treatment of patients with CMML. An allogeneic stem cell transplant can potentially offer a curative option to a subset of CMML patients. It is hoped that with the discovery of several novel mutations, targeted therapies will become available in the near future.",

The development of Sweet's syndrome in association with azacitidine use is rare (three published case reports since the drug's U.S. marketing approval in 2004), and the syndrome is not listed as a potential adverse reaction in the product packaging. In one of two cases of probable azacitidine-related Sweet's syndrome reported here, a 64-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) developed a severe erythematous and nodular rash with peeling on his arms, legs, and face after receiving the drug (75 mg/m(2) subcutaneously daily) for three days; the second case involved a 67-year-old man with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who experienced a similar skin rash, as well as chills and an elevated body temperature, after five days of treatment with azacitidine. In both cases, the results of dermatologic or pathologic examination and skin biopsies were consistent with Sweet's syndrome. Perhaps the strongest evidence of a drug-induced etiology in these cases was the close temporal relationship between the initiation of azacitidine use and the development of Sweet's syndrome, with prompt symptom resolution after the discontinuation of azacitidine use and administration of appropriate corticosteroid therapy. Azacitidine was the apparent cause of Sweet's syndrome in a patient with MDS and another with CMML. Both responded well to corticosteroid therapy. After resolution of the reaction, decitabine was given to the first patient and azacitidine to the second, without complications.",

Of 106 patients who received decitabine 20 mg/m(2) intravenously over 1\u2009h once daily for 5 days in 4-week cycles, 99 patients were evaluable after receiving at least two cycles. The overall improvement rate was 35% (19% complete response +4% marrow complete response +4% partial response +8% hematologic improvement). Overall survival at 2 years was 71%. Treatment-related adverse events included febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and bleeding, asthenia, fatigue, and eosinophilia. After complete response (CR), three patients received an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Four patients who relapsed after CR responded to decitabine retreatment. Acute myelogenous leukemia developed during follow-up in 21% of patients. Decitabine in a 5-day outpatient administration schedule was effective and well tolerated in typical clinical practice settings in South America and Asia.",

      "abstract": "Methylation of DNA at 5-position of cytosine, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases, is the predominant epigenetic modification in mammals. Aberrations in methylation play a causal role in a variety of diseases, including cancer. Recent studies have established that like mutation, methylation-mediated gene silencing often leads to tumorigenesis. Paradoxically, genome-wide DNA hypomethylation may also play a causal role in carcinogenesis by inducing chromosomal instability and spurious gene expression. Since methylation does not alter DNA base sequence, much attention has been focused recently on developing small molecule inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases that can potentially be used as anticancer agents. Vidaza (5-azacytidine), marketed by Pharmion (Boulder, CO, USA), was the first DNA methyltransferase inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for chemotherapy against myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a heterogeneous bone marrow disorder. Recently MGI Pharma Inc. (Bloomington, MN, USA) got FDA approval to market Dacogen (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, or decitabine) for treating MDS patients. These drugs were used earlier against certain anemias to induce expression of fetal globin genes. Interest in clinical trials of these drugs as anticancer agents has been renewed only recently because of reversal of methylation-mediated silencing of critical genes in cancer. Clinical trials have shown that both drugs have therapeutic potential against leukemia such as MDS, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. In contrast, their effectiveness with solid tumors appears to be less promising, which challenges researchers to develop inhibitors with more efficacy and less toxicity. The major hindrance of their usage as anticancer agents is their instability in vivo as well as the toxicity secondary to their excessive incorporation into DNA, which causes cell cycle arrest. Gene expression profiling in cancer cells revealed that antineoplastic property of these drugs is mediated through both methylation-dependent and -independent pathways. Recently, we have shown that treatment of cancer cells with these cytidine analogues also induces proteasomal degradation of DNA methyltransferase 1, the ubiquitously expressed enzyme upregulated in almost all cancer cells. Development of related stable drugs that can facilitate gene activation in cancer cells by enhancing degradation of DNA methyltransferases without being incorporated into DNA would be ideal for chemotherapy. In this monograph we review historical perspective and recent advances on the molecular mechanisms of action and clinical applications of these DNA hypomethylating agents.",

The objective of the current study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity profiles of decitabine and intensive chemotherapy in MDS. The authors compared lower intensity decitabine therapy (n = 115 patients) with intensive chemotherapy (as it is used in acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) in patients with higher risk MDS. Two comparisons were made with a cohort of 376 historic patients (from 1995 to 2005): The first comparison included a subcohort of 115 patients (Group A) who matched the 115 decitabine study patients according to age, International Prognostic Scoring System, and cytogenetics; and the second comparison included the whole cohort of 376 patients without matching (Group B). A multivariate analysis was performed for outcome. The complete remission (CR) rate according to AML criteria was 43% with decitabine, 46% with intensive chemotherapy in Group A, and 52% with intensive chemotherapy in Group B. Compared with Group A, mortality at 6 weeks was 3% with decitabine versus 13% with intensive chemotherapy (P = .006) and, at 3 months, 7% with decitabine versus 23% with intensive chemotherapy (P = .001). Survival was better with decitabine versus intensive chemotherapy in Group A (median survival: 22 months vs 12 months; P < .001). A multivariate analysis of survival in all 491 patients who received decitabine or intensive chemotherapy (Group B) selected decitabine as an independent, favorable prognostic factor for survival (P = .006; hazard ratio, 0.74) after accounting for the independent prognostic effect of pretreatment factors.

Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 50% of patients and thrombocytopenia of less than 50 x 10(9)/L in 50%. Topotecan was administered as 2 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for five days (10 mg/m2 per course) every 4 to 6 weeks for two courses, then at maximum tolerated dose level (1-2 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for five days) once every 4-8 weeks for a maximum of 12 courses. Evaluation of outcome and of differences among subgroups was performed according to standard methods; the criteria for response were those used for acute leukemia. Nineteen patients (31%) achieved a complete response (CR). A CR was achieved in 11 of 30 patients with MDS (37%) and in eight of 30 with CMML (27%). A CR was achieved in 10 of 23 patients with previously untreated MDS (43%). Eight of 11 patients who presented with cytogenetic abnormalities (five of which involved chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities) and achieved CR, were evaluated cytogenetically in CR: all were cytogenetically normal in CR. Characteristics associated with a higher CR rate were lack of previous chemotherapy, absence of ras oncogene mutations, and presence of less than 10% monocytes in either peripheral blood or bone marrow. In contrast, CR rates were similar by different agent groups, by different karyotype abnormalities, and by other pre-therapy peripheral blood counts. Non-myelosuppressive side effects were mucositis in 67% of patients (severe [grade 3-4] 23%), diarrhea in 38% (severe 17%), and nausea and vomiting in 28% (severe 5%). Febrile episodes during neutropenia occurred in 85% of patients and documented infections in 47 %. Mortality in the first four weeks was 20%. With a median follow-up duration of 31 months, the 12 month survival rate was 38%, median survival time 10.5 months, and median remission duration 7.5 months. In summary, topotecan has significant single-agent activity in MDS and CMML. Complete responses associated with topotecan therapy often involve the disappearance of abnormal, poor-prognosis karyotypes, which is particularly encouraging. Future strategies to optimize topotecan's role include combination regimens with topoisomerase II reactive agents, cytarabine, or hypomethylating agents (azacytidine and decitabine).",

Future strategies to optimize topotecan's role include combination regimens with topoisomerase II reactive agents, cytarabine, or hypomethylating agents (azacytidine and decitabine).",

The treatment options of low-dose Ara-C and haematopoietic growth factors are disappointing in regard to response rate or response duration. We tested the treatment with a 72-h continuous infusion of low-dose 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) in a group of 29 elderly patients with high-risk MDS. In 15 patients (54%) we observed a response. Eight complete responses were reached, even among patients with bad prognostic cytogenetic findings. The actuarial median survival from the start of the therapy was 46 weeks. The only (and major) toxicity was myelosuppression, leading to a prolonged cytopenic period and thus leading to five toxic deaths (17%) in this high-risk patient group. We conclude that DAC is an effective drug in the treatment of MDS patients and that it probably works via its cytotoxic activity. Myelotoxicity is its major adverse effect.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of topotecan in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Forty-seven patients with a diagnosis of MDS (n = 22) or CMML (n = 25) were treated. The median age was 66 years. Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 70% and thrombocytopenia less than 50 x 10(3)/microL in 51%. Evaluation of outcome and of differences among subgroups was performed according to standard methods; the criteria for response were those used for acute leukemia. Topotecan was administered as 2 mg/ m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for 5 days (10 mg/m2 per course) every 3 to 4 weeks until remission, then once every month for a maximum of 12 courses. Thirteen patients (28%) achieved a complete response (CR) and six (13%) had hematologic improvement. A CR was achieved in six of 22 patients with MDS (27%) and in seven of 25 with CMML (28%). All eight patients who presented with cytogenetic abnormalities (five chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities) who achieved CR were cytogenetically normal in CR. Characteristics for which there was evidence of association with a higher response rate were lack of prior chemotherapy, less than 10% marrow monocytes, and absence of RAS oncogene mutations. In contrast, CR rates were similar in patients with or without abnormal karyotypes. Mucositis occurred in 64% of patients (severe in 19%) and diarrhea in 32% (severe in 13%). Febrile episodes occurred in 85% of patients and documented infections in 47%. With a median follow-up duration of 8 months, the 12-month survival rate was 38%, median survival time 10.5 months, and median remission duration 7.5 months. We conclude that topotecan has significant activity in MDS and CMML, with acceptable side effects. Future studies will investigate topotecan combined with topoisomerase II reactive agents, cytarabine, or hypomethylating agents (azacytidine and decitabine).",
