    "abstract": "Enasidenib is an oral IDH2 inhibitor that reduces the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, differentiating IDH2 mutated leukemic cells with initial promising results for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. We performed a retrospective study in Spain evaluating enasidenib in patients diagnosed with IDH2-mutated myeloid neoplasms (AML, MDS, myeloid sarcoma and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Twenty-three patients were included, with 20 having a refractory/relapsed (R/R) disease status. The median age was 73 years, and the majority patients were classified as adverse risk by the European LeukemiaNet 2022 criteria. The most frequent mutation was IDH2 R140 (69.6%), while 30.4% had R172 mutation. Enasidenib was administered as a single agent in 18 patients, in combination with azacitidine in four patients, and with low-dose cytarabine in another one. The median number of cycles administered was four, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 39.1% and a morphological complete remission (CR) rate of 26.1%. Median overall survival (OS) was 8.3 months. Patients who achieved a complete response had a better outcome than the rest of the patients in terms of OS (19.8 months (95%CI: 15.7-NR) vs. 4.2 (95%CI: 1.5-NR), p\u2009=\u20090.01). Drug-related events included leukocytosis in five patients (21.7%), hyperbilirubinemia in six patients (26.1%) and differentiation syndrome (DS) in four patients (17.4%), including one grade 3 DS and one death related to this latter adverse event (AE), similar to previous findings. Although enasidenib failed to demonstrate a clear overall survival advantage in phase 3 trials, the extended responses and long-term survivors observed herein underscore its therapeutic potential. Ultimately, our data support enasidenib's role as a targeted therapy for IDH2-mutated AML, indicating that expanded access to this agent is warranted to optimize outcomes in these challenging patient populations, especially for R/R AML patients.",

    "abstract": "Atraumatic splenic rupture (ASR) is rare and typically attributed to underlying pathological conditions, with neoplastic diseases being the main etiologies. Traditionally, surgical intervention has been the standard approach for managing ASR in the majority of patients. However, reports on the outcomes of conservative management, especially for ASR related to myeloid neoplasms, are scarce. Here, we present two case reports involving ASR associated with myeloid neoplasms. The first patient, suffering from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) harboring CBL and ASXL1 mutations, developed ASR shortly after receiving treatment with the hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine. The second patient, in the blast phase of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), experienced ASR during the progression of their disease. In the initial case, despite experiencing intense abdominal pain and hypovolemic shock, the patient responded favorably to prompt fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion upon, thanks to a timely diagnosis. A non-operative management approach successfully averted the need for splenectomy or arterial embolism, leading to a favorable outcome. In the second case, the patient presented with progressive abdominal pain but remained hemodynamic stability throughout the ASR episode. We opted for a cautious approach, prioritizing resuscitation, close monitoring, and a watchful waiting strategy. Regrettably, the patient's condition deteriorated, marked by increasing splenomegaly, unchecked leukocytosis, and recurrent parenchymal hemorrhages. Here, we report two cases of ASR in myeloid neoplasms, demonstrating that patients may achieve acceptable outcomes with conservative management.",

The combination of hypomethylating agents with venetoclax (Ven) has demonstrated promising results in these diseases, although randomized clinical trials are needed for validation. In this retrospective study, we compared two matched cohorts of patients with MDS or CMML: one receiving oral decitabine-cedazuridine (DEC-C, n\u2009=\u200973) and one receiving DEC-C and Ven (DEC-C-Ven, n\u2009=\u200951), in three contemporary clinical trials. The aim is to determine the impact of the addition of Ven to HMA in MDS and CMML. Individuals were matched using a propensity score approach that was based on the IPSS-M score and age. All patients had excess blasts; 84% were diagnosed with MDS and 16% with CMML. Most patients had high- or very high-risk disease, according to the revised IPSS-R. The overall response rate was superior in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (90% vs 64%, P\u2009=\u20090.002).

Although epigenetic mechanisms are assumed, responding patients' epigenomes have not been thoroughly examined. We aimed to clarify HbF kinetics and prognostic value for azacytidine treated patients, as well as the epigenetic landscape that might influence HbF re-expression and its clinical relevance. Serial HbF measurements by high-performance liquid chromatography (n\u2009=\u200920) showed induction of HbF only among responders (p\u2009=\u20090.030). Moreover, HbF increase immediately after the first azacytidine cycle demonstrated prognostic value for progression-free survival (PFS) (p\u2009=\u20090.032, HR\u2009=\u20090.19, CI 0.24-1.63).

More recently, the true nature of the myeloid cells present in the cutaneous infiltrates of this theoretically reactive dermatitis is being clarified with the use of new molecular techniques such as next-generation sequencing. The same mutations in bone marrow (BM) myeloid neoplastic cells and in the cells of cutaneous infiltrates have been found. We present the case of a 77-year-old man who presented with spread and treatment-resistant skin granulomatous lesions previous to the diagnosis of CMML. The same clonal mutations in SRSF2, IDH1, and RUNX1 were found in both skin and BM with resolution of the lesions after the initiation of azacytidine. In conclusion, we report an exceptional case in which specific granulomatous cutaneous lesions have preceded and allowed the earlier diagnosis of an underlying CMML and a review of all previous similar cases in the literature, including molecular alterations.",

    "abstract": "Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) presents as a complex hematologic malignancy with myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features. Our case report explores the rare coexistence of CMML with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in a 63-year-old female patient. CMML diagnosis followed World Health Organization criteria, and the patient was classified as having high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-CMML stage 2. Initial treatment with subcutaneous azacytidine for CMML proved partially effective, highlighting persistent severe thrombocytopenia. Subsequent investigations revealed secondary ITP associated with Crohn's disease. Conventional ITP therapies, including high-dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin, showed limited efficacy. Eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, was initiated, resulting in the normalization of platelet counts within six weeks. Our case emphasizes the diagnostic challenges and intricate treatment landscape of CMML-associated ITP, suggesting eltrombopag as a potential therapeutic option in refractory cases. The study contributes to the evolving understanding of the complex interplay between myeloid disorders and immune-mediated hematological conditions, calling for personalized and multidisciplinary approaches to enhance patient outcomes.",

Introducing concepts like the MDS/AML overlap complicate classifications and including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) in MDS studies introduces another layer of complexity. The International Consortium for MDS emphasizes aligning HR MDS criteria with the 2022 ELN criteria for AML. Differences in advancements between AML and MDS treatments and hematological toxicity in HR MDS underline the importance of detailed trial designs. Effective therapeutic strategies require accurate reporting of adverse events, highlighting the need for clarity in criteria like the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

Outside of clinical trials, BM evaluations are only performed in ~50% of patients during follow-up, pinpointing a clinical need for response endpoints that do not necessitate BM assessments. We define and validate a new response type termed \"peripheral blood complete remission\" (PB-CR) that can be determined from the differential blood count and clinical parameters without necessitating a BM assessment. We compared the predictive value of PB-CR with morphologic CR/CRi in 1441 non-selected, consecutive patients diagnosed with MDS (n\u2009=\u2009522; 36.2%), CMML (n\u2009=\u2009132; 9.2%), or AML (n\u2009=\u2009787; 54.6%), included within the Austrian Myeloid Registry (aMYELOIDr; NCT04438889). Time-to-event analyses were adjusted for 17 covariates remaining in the final Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model. DeepSurv, a CPH neural network model, and permutation-based feature importance were used to validate results. 1441 patients were included. Adjusted median overall survival for patients achieving PB-CR was 22.8\u2009months (95%CI 18.9-26.2) versus 10.4\u2009months (95%CI 9.7-11.2) for those who did not; HR\u2009=\u20090.366 (95%CI 0.303-0.441; p\u2009<\u2009.0001).
